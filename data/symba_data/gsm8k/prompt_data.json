        "solution": "Example 1\nQuestion: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\n\nSolution:\nQ. How many pages did Maila read today?\nA. Maila read 12 x 2 = 24 pages today.\nQ. How many pages did Maila read since yesterday?\nA. So she was able to read a total of 12 + 24 = 36 pages since yesterday.\nQ. How many pages are left to be read?\nA. There are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left to be read. \nQ. How many pages should she read tomorrow?\nA. Since she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 = 42 pages.\nQ. The answer is: 42.\n\nExample 2\nQuestion: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\n\nSolution:\nQ. How many more purple flowers are there than yellow flowers?\nA. There are 80/100 * 10 = 8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.\nQ. How many purple flowers are there?\nA. So in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers.\nQ. How many flowers are there in total?\nA. Purple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = 28 flowers. \nQ. How many green flowers are there?\nA. That means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = 7 green flowers.\nQ. How many plants does Mark have in his garden?\nA. So in total Mark has 28 + 7 = 35 plants in his garden.\nThe answer is: 35.\n\nExample 3\nQuestion: Ursula bought five hot dogs at $1.50 each and three salads at $2.50 each. If she had two $10 bills, how much change did she get back?\n\nSolution:\nQ. How much do the hotdogs cost?\nA. Five hotdogs cost 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.\nQ. How much do the salads cost?\nA. Three salads cost 3 x $2.50 = $7.50.\nQ. How much did the hotdogs and salads cost in total?\nA. The total cost was $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.\nQ. How much money did Ursula have?\nA. And, Ursula had 2 x $10 = $20.\nQ. How much change did Ursula get back?\nA. Therefore, Ursula got a change of $20 - $15 = $5.\nThe answer is: 5.\n\nExample 4\nQuestion: {body_text}\n\nSolution:\n{current_answer}"

She drives at a rate of 30 miles per hour. If she is paid $.50 per mile, how much money does she make if she drives for 10 hours?\nAnswer: The truck driver drives for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so she drives 10 * 30 = 300 miles. Therefore, she needs 300 / 10 = 30 gallons of gas. This will cost her 30 * $2 = $60. She will make 300 * $.50 = $150. Thus, after paying for gas, she will make $150 - $60 = $90. #### 90\n\nExample 5\nQuestion: Building A has 4 floors, which is 9 less than Building B. Building C has six less than five times as many floors as Building B. How many floors does Building C have?\nAnswer: Building A has 4 floors. Building B has 4 + 9 = 13 floors. Therefore, Building C has (13 * 5) - 6 = 59 floors. #### 59\n\nExample 6\nQuestion: {body_text}\nAnswer:"
