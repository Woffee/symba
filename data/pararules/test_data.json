Eric is known for being a nice guy. For being so cold, it's good Gary can remain nice. If someone you know is big, cold, and young, you know they are also kind. Rough people who are kind and green with envy are red with their toughened skin. If someone plays rough and is nice and round, they will be big. Even though a person is big and rough when they are cold they turn red. Tom is a rough, young person to know, he is very green at his job but he is very round from his weight. Big people who are blue and red are afflicted with rough skin.",
