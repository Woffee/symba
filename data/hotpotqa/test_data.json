        "body_text": "Context:\n[Sukhoi S-54] The Sukhoi S-54 is a series of three closely related aircraft proposals; the S-54 trainer aircraft, S-55 light fighter designed for export, and the S-56 carrier-capable light fighter. All members of the family resemble the Sukhoi Su-27 in general form, or the Sukhoi Su-33 more closely, but built around a single example of the Saturn AL-31 engine instead of two, and scaled down accordingly to a smaller layout. The design was offered to several potential customers, including South Africa and India, but was turned down. Development is apparently on hold, awaiting a launch customer.\n\n[Levasseur PL.8] The Levasseur PL.8 was a single engine, two-seat long-distance record-breaking biplane aircraft modified from an existing Levasseur PL.4 carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft produced in France in the 1920s. Levasseur built the aircraft in 1927, specifically for pilots Charles Nungesser and François Coli for a transatlantic attempt to win the Orteig Prize. Only two examples of the type were built, with the first PL.8-01 named \"L'Oiseau Blanc\" (The White Bird), that gained fame as Nungesser and Coli's aircraft.\n\n[Loehle Spad XIII] The Loehle SPAD XIII is a family of American single-seat, biplane, conventional landing gear, single engine, ultralight aircraft produced in kit form by Loehle Aircraft for amateur construction. The aircraft meets the requirements of the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles regulations when equipped with a lightweight engine.\n\n[Piper PA-32R] The Piper PA-32R is a six-seat, high-performance, single engine, all-metal fixed-wing aircraft produced by Piper Aircraft of Vero Beach, Florida. The design began life as the \"Piper Lance\", a retractable gear version of the Piper Cherokee Six. Later models became known by the designation \"Piper Saratoga\". The primary difference between the Lance and early Saratoga is the development of a tapered wing on the Saratoga, replacing the \"Hershey Bar\" wing on the Lance that was a carryover from the Cherokee Six. Later Saratoga models provided updated/improved avionics, engine and interior touches but retained the same airframe design.\n\n[Hawker Hunter] The Hawker Hunter is a transonic British jet-powered fighter aircraft that was developed by Hawker Aircraft for the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was designed to take advantage of the newly developed Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engine and the swept wing, and was the first jet-powered aircraft produced by Hawker to be procured by the RAF. On 7 September 1953, the modified first prototype broke the world air speed record for aircraft, achieving a speed of 727.63 mph .\n\n[Chengdu J-10] The Chengdu J-10 ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 歼-10; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 殲-10; [[NATO reporting name]] : Firebird) is a lightweight [[multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] [[fighter aircraft]] capable of all-weather operation, configured with a [[delta wing]] and [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] design, with [[fly-by-wire]] flight controls, and produced by the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group|Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC)]] for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF).\n\n[Gotha G.VII] The Gotha G.VII. a.k.a.GL.VII, was a bomber aircraft produced in Germany during the final months of World War I. With the strategic bombing campaign effectively over, it was intended to be a high-speed tactical bomber with a secondary reconnaissance capability. It was a conventional two-bay biplane design with tractor-mounted engines, and a conventional empennage with twin fins and rudders. The bombardier's position in the nose of the aircraft that had featured on earlier Gotha designs was removed, and the nose of the aircraft severely truncated and fitted with a streamlined nose-cone. This allowed the engines to be located further inboard than on previous designs, bringing them closer to the aircraft's centreline and therefore minimising the effects of asymmetric thrust in the event of an engine failure. The engine nacelles also featured careful streamlining.\n\n[Saturn AL-31] The Saturn AL-31 is a family of military turbofan engines. It was developed by Lyulka, now NPO Saturn, of Soviet Union, originally for the Sukhoi Su-27 air superiority fighter. It produces a thrust of 123 kN (27,600 lb) with afterburning in the AL-31F, 137 kN (30,800 lb) in the AL-31FM (AL-35F) and 145 kN (32,000 lb) in the AL-37FU variants. Currently it powers all Su-27 derivatives and the Chengdu J-10 multirole jet fighter which has been developed by China.\n\n[Ayres Thrush] The Ayres Thrush, formerly the Snow S-2, Aero Commander Ag Commander, and Rockwell Thrush Commander, is an American agricultural aircraft produced by Ayres Corporation and more recently by Thrush Aircraft.

Typical of agricultural aircraft, it is a single-seat monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. Originally powered by a radial piston engine, most examples produced since the 1980s have been turboprop-powered.\n\n[Lavochkin La-9] The Lavochkin La-9 (NATO reporting name Fritz) was a Soviet fighter aircraft produced shortly after World War II. It was a piston engined aircraft produced at the start of the jet age.\n\nQuestion: Saturn AL-31 is an engine that powers the aircraft produced in what country?",

After action from several resistance groups in 1942 and the dynamic response of ELAS against members of the Legion, and the withdrawal of Italian forces, the Legion ceased to exist in September 1943, while Matousis fled to Athens.\n\n[Irgun] The Irgun (Hebrew: ארגון‎ ; full title: \"Hā-ʾIrgun Ha-Tzvaʾī Ha-Leūmī b-Ērētz Yiśrāʾel \", lit. \"The National Military Organization in the Land of Israel\") was a Zionist paramilitary organization that operated in Mandate Palestine between 1931 and 1948. It was an offshoot of the older and larger Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah (Hebrew: , Defence). When the group broke from the Haganah it became known as the \"Haganah Bet\" (Hebrew: literally \"Defense 'B' \" or \"Second Defense\", ), or alternatively as haHaganah haLeumit (ההגנה הלאומית ) or Hama'amad (). Irgun members were absorbed into the Israel Defense Forces at the start of the 1948 Arab–Israeli war.

SS members Odilo Globocnik and Karl Frenzel, and Ivan Marchenko are all said to have participated in the killings at this camp. The cremation facilities, the only ones built inside a concentration camp in Italy, were installed by Erwin Lambert. Today, the former concentration camp operates as a civic museum.\n\n[Nazi Germany paramilitary ranks] National Socialist paramilitary ranks were pseudo-military titles which were used by the Nazis, represented by the Nazi Party, the National Socialist German Workers' Party (\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\"; NSDAP), between the years of 1920 and 1945. Since the Nazi Party was by its very nature a paramilitary organization, by the time of the Second World War, several systems of paramilitary ranks had come into existence for both the Nazi Party itself and the various Nazi paramilitary organizations.\n\n[National Socialist Flyers Corps] The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: \"Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps\" ; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded April 15, 1937 as a successor to the German Air Sports Association; the latter had been active during the years when a German air force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The NSFK organization was based closely on the organization of the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes.\n\n[Vicente Castaño] José Vicente Castaño Gil aka El Profe (born July 2, 1957) is a Colombian paramilitary former leader of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing Colombian paramilitary organization.

It was the biggest and most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It saw itself as the successor to the original IRA and called itself simply the Irish Republican Army (IRA), or \"Óglaigh na hÉireann\" in Irish, and was widely referred to as such by others.\n\n[Schutzstaffel] The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes; ] ; literally \"Protection Squadron\") was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in Nazi Germany, and later throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II. It began with a small guard unit known as the \"Saal-Schutz\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (1929–45), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of security, surveillance, and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.\n\n[Night of the Long Knives] The Night of the Long Knives (German:    ), also called Operation Hummingbird (German: \"Unternehmen Kolibri\") or, in Germany, the Röhm Putsch (German spelling: \"Röhm-Putsch\" ), was a purge that took place in Nazi Germany from June 30 to July 2, 1934, when the Nazi regime carried out a series of political extrajudicial executions intended to consolidate Hitler's absolute hold on power in Germany. Many of those killed were leaders of the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA), the Nazis' own paramilitary organization, colloquially known as the \"Brownshirts\" due to the color of their uniforms. The best-known victim of the purge was Ernst Röhm, the SA's leader and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the left-wing Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party (NSDAP), along with its figurehead, Gregor Strasser, were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Bavarian politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had suppressed Adolf Hitler's Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The murders of SA leaders were also intended to improve the image of the Hitler government with a German public that was increasingly critical of thuggish Brownshirt tactics.\n\nQuestion: Erwin Lambert was a member of which paramilitary organization under Hitler?",

In Mac OS X v10.0, the first release of macOS, it was renamed System Profiler; with the release of Mac OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" it was again was renamed to System Information. Other new features in Lion are the ability to look up support information for the user's hardware model as well. In OS X Mountain Lion and later versions of macOS users can also access System Information by holding down the option key and \"System Information...\" will replace \"About This Mac\" in the Apple Menu.\n\n[Mac OS X 10.2] Mac OS X Jaguar, version 10.2, is the third major release of Mac OS X (now named macOS), Apple's desktop and server operating system. It superseded Mac OS X 10.1 and preceded Mac OS X Panther. The operating system was released on August 23, 2002 either for single-computer installations, and in a “family pack,” which allowed five installations on separate computers in one household. The operating system was generally well received by most Mac users as a large step forward in the areas of stability, general speed enhancements, compatibility with other flavors of Unix and the lineup of both graphical and terminal applications available; however, many critics, such as Amazon.com users, still claimed that significant user interface speed issues existed and that the operating system was still a big step down from Mac OS 9.\n\n[Sparse image] A sparse image is a type of disk image file used on macOS that grows in size as the user adds data to the image, taking up only as much disk space as stored in it. Encrypted sparse image files are used to secure a user's home directory by the FileVault feature in Mac OS X Snow Leopard and earlier.

        "body_text": "Context:\n[Cash (Chinese coin)] Cash was a type of coin of China and East Asia from the 4th century BC until the 20th century AD. Originally cast during the Warring States period these coins continued to be used for the entirety of Imperial China as well as under Mongol, and Manchu rule, the last Chinese cash coins were cast in the first year of the Republic of China. Generally most cash coins were made from copper or bronze alloys with iron, lead, and zinc coins occasionally appearing on a more uncommon basis throughout Chinese history, with rare silver, and gold cash coins appearing as well. During most of their production cash coins were cast but during the late Qing dynasty machine-struck cash coins began to be made. In the modern era these coins are now considered to be Chinese “good luck coins” and are used by hanging these coins round the necks of children, or over the beds of sick people, and hold a place in various other superstitions, as well as Traditional Chinese medicine, and Feng shui. Currencies based on the Chinese cash coins include the Japanese mon, Korean mun, Ryukyuan mon, and Vietnamese văn.\n\n[Nevisian dollar] The dollar was the currency of Nevis until 1830. The currency consisted of counterstamped Spanish and French colonial coins. The dollar was subdivided into 72 \"black dogs\", each of 1½ pence. Around 1801, coins were issued for 1, 4, 6, 7 and 9 black dogs with the word \"Nevis\" and the denomination stamped on them. The 1 black dog coins were countermarked on French Guianan 2 sous, whilst the 9 black dogs were made from Spanish colonial 1 real coins. In 1830, sterling was established as the official currency of the island.\n\n[Coins of the Hawaiian dollar] In 1847, the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, under the reign of King Kamehaheha III, issued its first official coinage—a large one-cent copper penny—to alleviate the chronic shortage of small denomination coins circulating in the Hawaiian Islands. The next and last official coinage of the Hawaiian Islands was minted in 1883, by King Kalākaua I; however during the intervening period, the changing needs of the Hawaiian Islands were met by circulating private-issued tokens and the coins of the United States of America.\n\n[Kalākaua coinage] The Kalākaua coinage was a set of silver coins of the Kingdom of Hawaii dated 1883, authorized to boost Hawaiian pride by giving the kingdom its own money. They were designed by Charles E. Barber, Chief Engraver of the United States Bureau of the Mint, and were struck at the San Francisco Mint. The issued coins are a dime (ten-cent piece), quarter dollar, half dollar, and dollar.\n\n[Coins of the United States dollar] Coins of the United States dollar were first minted in 1792. New coins have been produced annually since then and they make up a valuable aspect of the United States currency system. Today, circulating coins exist in denominations of 1¢ (i.e. 1 cent or $0.01), 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢, and $1.00. Also minted are bullion (including gold, silver and platinum) and commemorative coins. All of these are produced by the United States Mint. The coins are then sold to Federal Reserve Banks which in turn are responsible for putting coins into circulation and withdrawing them as demanded by the country's economy.\n\n[America the Beautiful Silver Bullion Coins] The America the Beautiful Silver Bullion Coins comprise a series of silver bullion coins with a face value of a quarter dollar. The coins contain five troy ounces of silver, making them the largest silver bullion coins ever issued by the United States Mint. The design of the coins duplicates exactly—though enlarged—each of the America the Beautiful Quarters. They have been issued since 2010 and will continue to be issued until at least 2021. The coins are available for sale during the year in which their corresponding circulating coin is issued. The coins are distributed by the United States Mint's network of authorized bullion dealers, and may be resold at the discretion of the Director of the National Park Service.\n\n[Tuvaluan dollar] The dollar is the currency of Tuvalu. From 1966 to 1976, Tuvalu officially used the Australian dollar. In 1976, Tuvalu began issuing its own coins for circulation, although these circulate alongside Australian coins and Tuvalu continues to use Australian banknotes. Similar to the Faroese króna's relationship to the Danish krone, the Tuvaluan dollar is not an independent currency, but a variation of the Australian Dollar. The official international currency code is TVD.\n\n[Setu coins] Setu coins or Setu bull coins are found in large quantities in the northern part of Sri Lanka and in Southern India. Codrington in his book \"Ceylon Coins and Currency\" published in 1924 and Mitchiner in his book \"Oriental Coins\" published in 1978 have clearly pointed out that the traditional design of Sri Lanka standing King Type Copper Massa (coins) of the Jaffna Kingdoms belongs to the Aryacakravarti dynasty from 1284 AD to 1410 AD. Setu coins were previously attributed to the Setupati Princes of Ramanathapuram in South India. There are two series one in the issued from the 13th to the 15th centuries and the other after the brief loss of sovereignty to the rival Kotte kingdom from 1450 to 1467 and reconstitution of the Kingdom. Even during the rule of Sapumal Kumaraya coins were issued in Jaffna that was distinct. Three types of this series are illustrated below. The obverse of these coins have a human figure flanked by lamps and the reverse has the Nandi (bull) symbol, the legend \"Sethu\" in Tamil with a crescent moon above.\n\n[Kamehameha III] Kamehameha III (born Kauikeaouli) (1813 – December 15, 1854) was the King of Hawaii from 1825 to 1854. His full Hawaiian name was Keaweaweʻ ula Kīwalaʻ ō Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa and then lengthened to Keaweaweʻ ula Kīwalaʻ ō Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa Kalani Waiakua Kalanikau Iokikilo Kīwalaʻ ō i ke kapu Kamehameha when he ascended the throne.\n\n[Dollar coin (United States)] The dollar coin is a United States coin worth one United States dollar. It is the third largest American coin currently minted in terms of physical size, with a diameter of 1.043 inches (26.5 mm) and a thickness of .079 inches (2 mm), coming second to the half dollar. Dollar coins have been minted in the United States in gold, silver, and base metal versions. Dollar coins were first minted in the United States in 1794. The term silver dollar is often used for any large white metal coin issued by the United States with a face value of one dollar, whether or not it contains some of that metal. While true gold dollars are no longer minted, the Sacagawea and Presidential dollars are sometimes referred to as golden dollars due to their color.\n\nQuestion: How long did the king who created the coins of the hawaiian dollar rule?",

He was elected King of Germany at Frankfurt on 4 March 1152 and crowned in Aachen on 9 March 1152. He became King of Italy in 1155 and was crowned Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV on 18 June 1155. Two years later, the term \"sacrum \" (\"holy\") first appeared in a document in connection with his Empire. He was later formally crowned King of Burgundy, at Arles on 30 June 1178. He was named \"Barbarossa \" by the northern Italian cities which he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means \"red beard\" in Italian; in German, he was known as \"Kaiser Rotbart \", which has the same meaning.\n\n[List of Holy Roman Empresses] Holy Roman Empress or Empress of the Holy Roman Empire is the title given to the consort (wife) or regent of the Holy Roman Emperor. The elective dignity of Holy Roman Emperor was restricted to males only, therefore there was never a Holy Roman Empress regnant, though women such as Theophanu or Maria Theresa of Austria, who controlled the power of rule, served as de facto Empresses regnant.\n\n[Battle of Cingoli] The Battle of Cingoli was fought in 1250 between the forces of the Holy Roman Empire and the armies of the Guelphs and the Papal States, the area being so notable due to its nickname as \"The Balcony of Marche\". The Imperial forces inflicted a crushing defeat on the Pope's factions. After the battle, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor was smitten with leprosy, and Pope Innocent IV declared the illness to be an act of God. This was most probably due to the Emperor's excommunication; a common threat and practice for subduing overconfident Catholic leadership.\n\n[Karl Anselm, 4th Prince of Thurn and Taxis] Karl Anselm, 4th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, full German name: \"Karl Anselm Fürst von Thurn und Taxis\" (2 June 1733, Frankfurt am Main, Free Imperial City of Frankfurt, Holy Roman Empire – 13 November 1805, Winzer bei Regensburg, Electorate of Bavaria, Holy Roman Empire) was the fourth Prince of Thurn and Taxis, Postmaster General of the Imperial Reichspost, and Head of the Princely House of Thurn and Taxis from 17 March 1773 until his death on 13 November 1805. Karl Anselm served as \"Prinzipalkommissar\" at the Perpetual Imperial Diet in Regensburg for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor from 1773 to 1797.\n\n[Treaty of Ceprano (1230)] The Treaty of Ceprano was signed in Ceprano on August 1230 between Pope Gregory IX and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Based on the terms of the accord, Frederick agreed not to violate any territories held by the Papacy. In return for Frederick's concessions in Sicily, the Pope removed his sentence of excommunication. Overall, the treaty helped to establish lines of reconciliation between the Holy Roman Empire and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n[Battle of Parma] The Battle of Parma was fought on 18 February 1248 between the forces of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and the Guelphs. The Guelphs attacked the Imperial camp when Frederick II was away. The Imperial forces were defeated and much of Frederick's treasure was lost.\n\n[Papal election, 1241] The papal election, following the death of Pope Gregory IX, from September 21 to October 25, 1241 elected Cardinal Goffredo da Castiglione as Pope Celestine IV. The election took place during the first of many protracted \"sede vacantes\" of the Middle Ages, and like many of them was characterized by disputes between popes and the Holy Roman Emperor. Specifically, the election took place during the war between Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor against the Lombard League and the deceased pontiff, Pope Gregory IX, with Italy divided between pro-Papal and pro-Imperial factions known as the Guelphs and Ghibellines.\n\n[Constance, Queen of Sicily] Constance (2 November 1154 – 27 November 1198) was Queen regnant of Sicily in 1194–98, jointly with her spouse from 1194 to 1197, and with her infant son Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1198, as the heiress of the Norman kings of Sicily. She was also Holy Roman Empress by marriage to Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n[Gerasim Zelić] Gerasim Zelić (Serbian: Герасим Зелић ; 1752–1828) was a renowned Serbian Orthodox Church archimandrite, traveller and writer (a contemporary and compatriot of Dositej Obradović). His chief work is \"Žitije\" (Lives), in three volumes. They are memoirs of his travels throughout western Europe, Russia and Asia Minor from the latter half of the 18th century to the first decade of the 19th century and the famous personalities (Napoleon, Prince Eugène, Viceroy of Naples, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, Semyon Zorich, Catherine the Great, Alexander I of Russia, Stanisław August Poniatowski, Dositej Obradović) he met.

Originally named \"Yngve\", she was built at Björkenäs, Sweden, and fitted with a 58 H.P. auxiliary oil engine.\n\n[Priestman Brothers] Priestman Brothers was an engineering company based in Kingston upon Hull, England that manufactured diggers, dredgers, cranes and other industrial machinery. In the later 1900s the company also produced the Priestman Oil Engine, an early design of oil fuelled internal combustion engine.\n\n[Hornsby-Akroyd oil engine] The Hornsby-Akroyd oil engine was the first successful design of internal combustion engine using \"heavy oil\" as a fuel. It was the first to use a separate vapourising combustion chamber and is the forerunner of all hot-bulb engines.\n\n[Oil engine] An oil engine is an internal combustion engine that is powered by the burning of fuel oil, as opposed to external combustion engines, such as steam engine. The term usually refers to low compression engines, so the diesel engine is usually not included.\n\n[Fiat 615] At first the model had a new petrol engine with 1395 cc and 29 kW (39 hp) at 3800 rpm to 1400 Fiat, and had a manual 4-speed transmission. A 1.5 ton truck was newly developed, which was offered from 1951 in a flatbed and chassis for special bodies. It was powered by the engine of the prior year featured Fiat 1400s. The engine was already in the car Fiat 1400 was just sufficient, and with the 3.1 tons it had real trouble. Once in motion, the Fiat 615 was indeed 80 km/hr fast, but with forced driving it had poor fuel efficiency. There was a reason that the 1100 Fiat ELR far built until 1954. The somewhat weaker beast of burden was, with its 1.1 liter and 28/30 PS (at 4400 rpm) a little lame, but it had fully loaded a ton to move less weight, so was more economical. It therefore retained its loyal following who forgave its manageable liveliness out of habit, especially as it came with start-up to a peak of over 90 km/hr and thus was significantly faster than the Fiat 615 with its maximum of 78 km/hr. With high pressure, therefore a suitable diesel engine was developed by Fiat: a swirl chamber engine (Ricardo System) based on the 1.9 liter engine for the \"big\" Fiat in 1900 and the new SUV Fiat Campagnola. (This engine was a hubvergrößerte variant of the 1400 engine.) The new diesel engine (type 305) was later also available in either sedan 1400 from 1952 in addition to the Fiat 615 N (N = Nafta = Diesel) and one year in Fiat Campagnola and Fiat. Although the experiment of the Fiat 615 built 1.9 L gasoline engine proved to be stronger and with faster drive spurt, confined themselves to the diesel, the Type 615 N. Only Steyr in Austria until 1958 offered the Fiat 615 as gasoline, as Steyr 260 with its own 50 hp 2 L gasoline engine from the car Steyr 2000. The Fiat 615 N was a very modern vehicle that in Italy, initially had no competition. The export ran well at the beginning, missing, or half-hearted development left the Fiat 615 N (and especially its successor) over the years become increasingly rare even in Italy. In Zastava in Yugoslavia, the Fiat 615 was built with a petrol engine under license. However, not as the beginning of the Fiat, with the 1.4 L 4-cylinder engine, but with the much stronger torque 1.9 liter engine (type 105) with 47 hp at 3500 RPM, as well as in the, also at Zastava built under license, Campagnola was used. It is unclear whether the successor (from about 1963, as Fiat 615 N1) only with the 1.9 liter petrol engine (such as 615 B) was built, with a diesel engine.\n\n[Crude oil engine] The crude oil engine is a type of internal combustion engine similar to the hot bulb engine. A crude oil engine could be driven by all sorts of oils such as engine waste oil and vegetable oils. Even peanut oil and butter could be used as fuel if necessary. Like hot bulb engines, crude oil engines were mostly used as stationary engines or in boats. They can run for a very long time; for instance, at the world fair in Milan in 1906, a FRAM engine was started and ran until the exhibition was over one month later. A crude oil engine is a low RPM engine dimensioned for constant running and can last for a very long time if maintained properly. It was later replaced by the diesel engine.\n\n[St Vincents Hall] St Vincents Hall, Grantham, is a Gothic Revival mansion built in 1868 for the industrialist Richard Hornsby who founded Richard Hornsby & Sons, engine and machinery manufacturer.\n\n[Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons] Richard Hornsby & Sons was an engine and machinery manufacturer in Lincolnshire, England from 1828 until 1918. The company was a pioneer in the manufacture of the oil engine developed by Herbert Akroyd Stuart, which was marketed under the \"Hornsby-Akroyd\" name. The company developed an early track system for vehicles, selling the patent to Holt & Co. (predecessor to Caterpillar Inc.) in America. In 1918, Richard Hornsby & Sons became a subsidiary of the neighbouring engineering firm Rustons of Lincoln, to create \"Ruston & Hornsby\".\n\n[Herbert Akroyd Stuart] Herbert Akroyd-Stuart (28 January 1864, Halifax, Yorkshire, England – 19 February 1927, Halifax) was an English inventor who is noted for his invention of the hot bulb engine, or heavy oil engine.\n\n[Associated British Oil Engine Company] The Associated British Oil Engine Company (ABOE) was a British engineering company. It started life as a combine, similar to Agricultural & General Engineers. Petters Limited joined ABOE in 1937. J&H McLaren & Co. was sold to ABOE in 1943, although it may have been a member from an earlier date. In 1945 Mirrlees, Bickerton and Day joined the group followed by the National Gas and Oil Engine company in 1950.\n\nQuestion: What type of mansion was built for the founder of the company marketed the oil engine under the \"Hornsby-Akroyd\" name?",

He studied architecture at Lafayette college and, upon graduation, entered the office of A.B. Mullet, who had formerly been supervising architect of the United States Treasury. Ashford entered the District service in 1895 and became Washington's first municipal architect. The \"Washington Post\" characterized him as \"Architect of the Everyday\", and noted: \"Ashford designed or supervised everything the District built between 1895 and 1921, including the North Hall at the Eastern Market. But he was most proud of his schools.\"\n\n[Eastern Market station] Eastern Market is an island platformed Washington Metro station in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C., United States. The station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The station currently provides service for the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines. The station is located in Southeast Washington at Pennsylvania Avenue and 7th Street. It is named after the nearby Eastern Market, a historic Washington, D.C. public marketplace.\n\n[Lew Johnson] Lew Johnson was an African-American owner and business manager of blackface minstrel troupes composed of African-American performers. His career began in the mid-1860s and spanned 25 years. Johnson is the only black minstrel-troupe owner to have enjoyed any consistent success (others, such as Charles Hicks, were constantly fluctuating between success to failure). This was due to his keeping well away from the lucrative markets dominated by white owners. He primarily toured in the Midwestern and Western United States, playing countless one-nighters in rural settlements. The people in these areas could be racist (perhaps more than in the East), which made the itinerant lifestyle a hard one for Johnson and his minstrels. Johnson made a brief venture into the Eastern market in 1886, but his troupe fared poorly and fled back west.\n\nQuestion: In what regions of the United States is the Eastern Market, Detroit located?",

        "body_text": "Context:\n[James Stuart (opera director)] James F. Stuart (23 December 1928, Baton Rouge, Louisiana — 7 March 2005) was an American opera director and operatic tenor. He began his career performing and touring with Dorothy Raedler’s American Savoyards. He became a specialist in the patter roles of Gilbert and Sullivan, including Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B. in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", Ko-Ko in \"The Mikado\", and Reginald Bunthorne in \"Patience\" among others. In 1979 he founded the Ohio Light Opera in Wooster, Ohio, serving as the company's artistic director for two decades. During his tenure there he also often worked as producer, stage director, translator, and performer. He himself performed in fifty of the more than two hundred productions mounted by the company while he was director. He also sang on twenty of the company's live operetta recordings, which encompassed works by both Americans and Europeans.\n\n[Bell pattern] A bell pattern is a rhythmic pattern of striking a hand-held bell or other instrument of the Idiophone family, to make it emit a sound at desired intervals. It is often a \"key pattern\" (also known as a \"guide pattern\", \"phrasing referent\", \"timeline\", or \"asymmetrical timeline\"), in most cases it is a metal bell, such as an agogô, gankoqui, or cowbell, or a hollowed piece of wood, or wooden claves. In formal music, bell patterns are also played on the metal shell of the timbales, and drum kit cymbals.\n\n[Patter song] The patter song is characterised by a moderately fast to very fast tempo with a rapid succession of rhythmic patterns in which each syllable of text corresponds to one note. It is a staple of comic opera, especially Gilbert and Sullivan, but it has also been used in musicals and elsewhere.\n\n[Drum beat] A drum beat or drum pattern is a rhythmic pattern, or repeated rhythm establishing the meter and groove through the pulse and subdivision, played on drum kits and other percussion instruments. As such a \"beat\" consists of multiple drum strokes occurring over multiple musical beats while the term \"drum beat\" may also refer to a single drum stroke which may occupy more or less time than the current pulse. Many drum beats define or are characteristic of specific music genres.\n\n[Keplok] Keplok is a style of clapping used in Javanese gamelan. The clapping is in a specific interlocking rhythmic pattern and is performed by the gerong when they are not singing. It is usually associated with the lively ciblon (Surakarta) or batangan (Yogyakarta) drumming. Usually one person claps on the on-beats while another claps on the off-beats, and then another pair clap a similar pattern at half the tempo. This interlocking pattern is similar to the imbal patterns played on the saron. Keplok is often performed along with senggakan.\n\n[Cadence (music)] In Western musical theory, a \"cadence\" (Latin \"cadentia\", \"a falling\") is \"a melodic or harmonic configuration that creates a sense of resolution [finality or pause]\". A harmonic cadence is a progression of (at least) two chords that concludes a phrase, section, or piece of music. A rhythmic cadence is a characteristic rhythmic pattern that indicates the end of a phrase. A cadence is labelled more or less \"weak\" or \"strong\" depending on its sense of finality. While cadences are usually classified by specific chord or melodic progressions, the use of such progressions does not necessarily constitute a cadence—there must be a sense of closure, as at the end of a phrase. Harmonic rhythm plays an important part in determining where a cadence occurs.\n\n[Tumdak'] The tumdak' is a hand-struck double-headed membranophone of the Santal people of India. The Santal typically use the Tumdak' in combination with the Tamah' for religious ceremonies and Santal festivals. Both drums are almost universally played by men rather than women. The body of the drum is cylindrical and made from clay. The two heads of the drum are usually cowhide, the right one being slightly smaller than the left. Like many similar Indian drums, each head has a round patch of tuning paste in the center which enhances the sound. When played for dancing, the Tumdah' player suspends the drum around his neck with a cord or leather strap. The Tumdah' falls within the larger category of double-headed hand-struck Indian drums, which have various names: Dholak, Nal, Mridangam. The player strikes the Tumdak' with full hand and fingers as required by the musical pattern. The rhythm of the Tamak' and Tumdak' set the basic metric/rhythmic pattern for Santal dances and are essential for traditional Santal music.\n\n[Tarantas] Tarantas and Taranto are two related styles (\"palos\") of Flamenco music, that originated in the \"Andalusian\" province of Almería. Each is characterized by a shared modality (F-sharp Phrygian) and harmonic progression (Bm - A7 - G - F-sharp), but differ significantly with respect to rhythm and meter. \"Tarantas\" is a cante libre (or tocque libre, if played as a solo), meaning that it lacks both a regular rhythmic pattern (\"compás\", in flamenco terminology) and a regular rhythmic unit (or beat). It can be sung or played, but not danced. \"Taranto\", conversely, has a regular 2/4 meter, and is danceable. When played on, or accompanied by, the guitar, both \"palos\" have a unique and characteristic sound that is created, in part, by dissonances that result from the use of the guitar's first three open strings (E, B, and G, respectively), in combination with harmonies and melodies based on the F-sharp Phrygian mode.\n\n[Oscillating gene] In molecular biology, an oscillating gene is a gene that is expressed in a rhythmic pattern or in periodic cycles. Oscillating genes are usually circadian and can be identified by periodic changes in the state of an organism. Circadian rhythms, controlled by oscillating genes, have a period of approximately 24 hours. For example, plant leaves opening and closing at different times of the day or the sleep-wake schedule of animals can all include circadian rhythms. Other periods are also possible, such as 29.5 days resulting from circalunar rhythms or 12.4 hours resulting from circatidal rhythms. Oscillating genes include both core clock component genes and output genes. A core clock component gene is a gene necessary for to the pacemaker. However, an output oscillating gene, such as the AVP gene, is rhythmic but not necessary to the pacemaker.\n\n[Six Melodies (Cage)] Six Melodies is a collection of six pieces for violin and keyboard instrument by John Cage. It was composed in 1950, shortly after Cage completed his \"String Quartet in Four Parts\". The work uses the same techniques: the gamut technique and the nested rhythmic proportions. First, a fixed number of sonorities (single tones, intervals and aggregates) is prepared, each created independently of the other. These sonorities are called gamuts. Sequences of gamuts are then used to create melodies with harmonic backgrounds that are in no way connected to functional harmony, which Cage sought to avoid. The collection of gamuts used in \"Six Melodies\" is nearly identical to the one used in the \"String Quartet\" (Cage called \"Six Melodies\" \"a postscript\" to that work). The structure of each piece, and that of each phrase, is defined by the same rhythmic pattern: 3 1/2, 3 1/2, 4, 4, 3, 4. The violinist is instructed in the score to play without vibrato and with minimum weight on the bow.\n\nQuestion: James Stuart became a specialist of a rhythmic pattern charecterised by what?",

The first election using the new district boundaries (listed below) were the 2012 congressional elections.\n\n[Shelley Sekula-Gibbs] Shelley Sekula-Gibbs (born June 22, 1953 in Floresville, Texas) is a physician and a former member of the United States House of Representatives representing  's 22 congressional district from November 13, 2006, until January 3, 2007. She has also served as a City Councilwoman in Houston, Texas for three terms. She won the Special Election to fill the 22nd Congressional seat on November 7, 2006, for the remaining weeks of the 109th United States Congress. On the same day, she also lost in the general election for that seat in the 110th United States Congress. Thereby she was in the interesting position of being a lame duck the moment she was elected. In the 2008 campaign for the Republican nomination in the 22nd Congressional District, she finished first in the initial primary, but lost in a runoff to Pete Olson.\n\n[Rico Oller] Thomas \"Rico\" Oller (born July 16, 1958) is a Republican U.S. politician from California. He served in the California State Assembly, representing the 4th District from 1996 to 2000, and the California State Senate, representing the 1st district from 2000 to 2004. In 2004, Oller ran for Congress in California's 3rd congressional district, but narrowly lost the Republican primary to former California Attorney General Dan Lungren. On January 10, 2008, Oller again ran for Congress, this time in California's 4th congressional district, for a seat being vacated by retiring Congressman John Doolittle. He faced opposition from former Congressman Doug Ose. On March 4, 2008, Oller dropped out of the race when California State Senator Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) announced that he was running for Doolittle's seat. In a statement, Oller said his decision was \"a bitter pill indeed for me to swallow.\" But, he said he was endorsing McClintock to prevent the election of Ose, whom he labeled as \"an unarguably liberal Republican.\" Oller ran for the newly former 5th Assembly District in 2012 facing Madera County Supervisor Frank Bigelow in the November general election. Oller lost to Bigelow by 5.7%.\n\n[Kansas's 1st congressional district] Kansas's 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Kansas. Commonly known as \"The Big First\", the district encompasses 63 counties in western and northern Kansas (more than half of the state), making it the 12th largest congressional district in the nation. Located within the district are Manhattan, Salina, Dodge City, Emporia, Garden City, Hays and Hutchinson. From 2011 to 2017, the district was represented by Republican Tim Huelskamp who was originally elected in 2010 to succeed fellow Republican Jerry Moran who ran successfully for the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by now Governor Sam Brownback. Huelskamp was re-elected twice in 2012 and 2014, but lost the 2016 Republican primary for a fourth term to obstetrician Roger Marshall.\n\n[Willie Vaden] Willie Vaden (born April 7, 1948 in Grapeland, Texas) is a former mayor of Ingleside, Texas, and was the Republican nominee for the United States House of Representatives in Texas's 27th congressional district in 2004, 2006 and 2008.\n\n[Georgia's 3rd congressional district] Georgia's 3rd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia.

The first election using the new district boundaries (listed below) were the 2012 congressional elections.\n\n[Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district] Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District is located in the central and northeast regions of the state. The district was one of the 12 original districts created prior to the 4th Congress. It is currently represented by Republican Tom Marino, who defeated Democratic incumbent Chris Carney during the 2010 U.S. House elections. In 2006, the 10th district experienced one of the greatest party shifts among all House seats that switched party control: in 2004, Republican Don Sherwood won with an 86% margin of victory over his nearest opponent and two years later, Carney unseated Sherwood by a 53%–47% margin. In 2008, Carney won reelection by 12 points but the district swung back in 2010, electing Tom Marino. The district is mostly Republican in its political composition, an aspect of the district that is reflected especially well in presidential elections. In 2004, President George W. Bush won 60 percent of the vote in the district and in 2008, Senator John McCain beat Senator Barack Obama here by a margin of 54 percent to 45 percent. Nonetheless, Carney easily won reelection as a Democrat the same year McCain won the district. However, in the 2010 midterm elections, Marino unseated Carney by a 55%–45% margin. In 2016, local business man and former mayor of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, Mike Molesevich challenged Marino for the seat, but he fell to the Republican in November by more than two to one. Marino remains the congressman in the 10th district, but he has expressed interest in a 2018 gubernatorial run rather than standing for reelection.\n\n[Georgia's 11th congressional district] Georgia's 11th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Georgia. The district is currently represented by Republican Barry Loudermilk. The district's boundaries have been redrawn following the 2010 census, which granted an additional congressional seat to Georgia.

During the morning of April 3, a large low-pressure area and associated frontal boundaries tracked across the Southern US Plains. Initially, environmental conditions did not favor the development of tornadoes. However, an outflow boundary from an area of storms in Oklahoma moved southwards before stalling over the Dallas–Fort Worth area. This allowed the formation of individual supercells, which would produce numerous tornadoes in the region. Many of these tornadoes occurred in the afternoon and evening hours of the day. One of these tornadoes was an EF3 tornado which struck areas of Forney, Texas, damaging homes and businesses; this tornado would be the strongest confirmed during the outbreak. However, the costliest tornado was of EF2 intensity, and struck the counties of Ellis and Dallas, causing roughly $400 million in damages. The same tornado also injured 10 people, but did not cause any damage. Throughout the duration of the outbreak, there were 22 confirmed tornadoes, though 17 of them were rated EF0 – the lowest rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.\n\n[Robert Hughes (basketball)] Robert Hughes Sr. (born May 15, 1928 in Bristow, Oklahoma, United States) is the United States' all-time winningest high school basketball coach.

        "body_text": "Context:\n[List of golf courses in The Villages] One of the key advertising campaigns of The Villages is that residents are able to play \"free golf for life\". The advertising is only partially true; the \"free golf\" is paid for by mandatory amenities fees assessed to all homeowners in The Villages. The \"free golf\" extends only to the executive golf courses and only to players walking the courses, wherein a greens fee is not assessed. Players riding golf carts on executive courses pay no greens fee but must pay a trail fee. Greens fees and trail fees are required on The Villages country club courses (though memberships are provided \"free\" – again, as part of the amenities fee – to residents).\n\n[English rule (attorney's fees)] In the field of law and economics, the English rule (capitalized as English Rule in some jurisdictions) is a rule controlling assessment of attorneys' fees arising out of litigation. The English rule provides that the party who loses in court pays the other party's attorney's fees. The English rule contrasts with the American rule, under which each party is generally responsible to pay its own attorneys' fees, unless a statute or contract provides for that assessment. The rationale for the English rule is that a litigant (whether bringing a claim or defending a claim) is entitled to legal representation and, if successful, should not be left out of pocket by reason of his or her own legal fees. It should be borne in mind that, in virtually all English civil litigation, damages are merely compensatory.\n\n[Universal transit pass] Universal Transit Pass or Universal Access Transit Pass (U-Pass) is a program that gives students enrolled in participating post-secondary institutions unlimited access to local transit. Programs are either funded through mandatory fees that eligible students pay in each term in which they are registered or included in the students' tuition. For example, the University of Washington and the U-Pass program in Chicago have mandatory U-Pass fees. Fees are transferred to the local transit authority to fund the required transit service. Because fees are collected from a large participant base, U-Pass prices are lower than the amount students would otherwise pay for monthly passes or tickets over the course of a term. The U-Pass price charged to students depends on a variety of factors which differ among municipalities, transit systems and post-secondary institutions.\n\n[Forage value index] The Forage Value Index is a derived index of the relative change in the previous year’s average monthly rate per head for pasturing cattle on privately owned land in the West. Used in calculating federal grazing fees.\n\n[Maintenance fee (EPA)] In United States environmental policy, maintenance fees are the annual fees paid by pesticide manufacturers and formulators to continue registration of pesticide active ingredients and products with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The fees supplement funds appropriated from general U.S. revenues, which cover most administrative costs of the EPA pesticide program under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA; 7 U.S.C. 136a-1). Fees are deposited into a separate Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund to offset costs associated with EPA reregistration activities and expedited processing of pesticide registrations that are substantially similar to registrations already in effect or which are for public health pesticides, as defined in FIFRA Section 2(nn). Congress mandated collection of an annual maintenance fee from each pesticide registrant in 1988 amendments to (P.L. 100-532). EPA has authority to cancel a registration if a registrant fails to pay the maintenance fee.\n\n[Bundy standoff] The 2014 Bundy standoff was an armed confrontation between supporters of cattle rancher Cliven Bundy and law enforcement following a 21-year legal dispute in which the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had obtained court orders directing Bundy to pay over $1 million in withheld grazing fees for Bundy's use of federally owned land adjacent to Bundy's ranch in southeastern Nevada.\n\n[Citizens for Constitutional Freedom] Citizens for Constitutional Freedom (C4CF), later also known as People for Constitutional Freedom (P4CF), was the name taken on January 4, 2016, by an armed private U.S. militia that occupied the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters in the U.S. state of Oregon from January 2 to February 11, 2016. The leader of the organization was Ammon Bundy, son of Cliven D. Bundy, who engaged in a standoff with the federal government over grazing rights on federal land.\n\n[Stealth inflation] Stealth inflation is a type of charges or fees created by businesses to gain extra profit and revenue from its customers. The stealth part of the term is that business will often use miscellaneous fees to charge customers without the customers even knowing the fees existed as they were hidden in the fine print of a signed a contract. The inflation part of the term relates to the up charging of the service without actually providing anything additional. Since most companies charge a fee to accept payment, a portion gets built into profit and revenue. A big example of stealth inflation can be overdraft fees from banks surcharges from Telco providers, processing fees and installation fees. Another form of stealth inflation is devaluation of money by a government, sometimes in order to pay off debt with lower value currency. The unintended higher cost of imported goods and raw material is passed on to the consumer yet not part of traditional definition of inflation.\n\n[Cliven Bundy] Cliven D. Bundy (born April 29, 1946) is an American cattle rancher from Bunkerville, Nevada who is currently federally incarcerated and awaiting trial with bail denied for his role in the 2014 Bundy standoff. He vocally advocated a philosophy opposed to what he views as federal government overreach. He is known for having participated in the 2014 Bundy Standoff in Nevada, an armed standoff with federal and state law enforcement over defaulted grazing fees. Some viewed him as a hero for having led a movement of ranchers to encourage more ranchers to join him in defaulting on their grazing fees as per their federal grazing contracts. Some considered him to be dangerously provocative. He is the father of Ammon Bundy, who in 2016 also led another armed standoff against the government, the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.\n\n[Sentinel Offender Services] In 2012, James Hucks filed suit against Sentinel Offender Services after an arrest warrant was issued for his wife because she did not pay all the fees she owed to the company during her probation. In 2013, Georgia judge Daniel J. Craig ruled that Sentinel had to refund hundreds, and possibly thousands, of people who had paid them, and that private probation companies cannot collect fees from probationers after their probation has expired. Later that year, Craig granted Sentinel a stay on this ruling, but, despite their attempts to persuade him to back down on it, refused to undo his restrictions. In 2012, Georgia man Tom Barrett stole a can of beer and was later put on probation with Sentinel after being unable to pay a US$200 fine. He was later put in jail for two months after being unable to pay Sentinel's startup fee. As of May 2015, Barrett was suing Sentinel, and was being represented by Augusta attorney Jack Long. On February 17, 2016, the Southern Center for Human Rights filed a lawsuit against Sentinel on behalf of two women from Cleveland, Georgia who were sentenced to 12 months probation each for not paying fines; the lawsuit also claims both women were told they had to undergo drug tests by a probation officer.\n\nQuestion: How much was Ammon Bundy's son ordered to pay in grazing fees?",

The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named \"Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers\". The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people. Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers. For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting. None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched. Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia.

It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin. Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit. When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe. In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time. He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them. By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville. In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers. Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler. Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass. This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none. Finally, on October 1, 2009, The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers got their due when they were inducted into the International Bluegrass Hall of Fame at the Ryman Theater (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry). Bobby Osborne, Melvin Goins and Paul Williams were there to receive the bands award. In the crowd of a sold out theater was the son of Ezra Cline, Scotty Ireland Cline, who recalled being in that same theater as a child sitting on stage and watching the Fiddlers play. (At the time, the Opry had bleachers for family just off stage). The final act of the evening at the IBMA Awards was the playing of \"Pain in my Heart\" by Osborne, Goins and Williams along with a Song from the Dillards, who were also inducted the same evening.\n\n[1982 Cline] 1982 Cline, provisional designation 1975 VA, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 8 kilometers in diameter.

Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure. Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's. Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed. Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion. Thus the birth of Modifications. It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance. FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence. Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal. Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash. Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them. Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s. During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions. The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices. During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization. Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow. The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'. that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow. Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead. This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder. The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally. The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally. Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions. Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason. Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification. Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds. While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008. The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate. It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders. Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned. Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public. Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.\n\n[Case Gym] Case Gym is a 1,800-seat multi-purpose arena at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts.

However, if a Deputy Prime Minister has not been appointed, the Minister in the cabinet who has served the longest time (and if there are several with equal experience the one who is oldest) takes over as head of government. Note that the person acting as Prime Minister does not do so on a permanent basis: if a Prime Minister dies, resigns or loses a vote of confidence in the Riksdag, the Speaker of the Riksdag will then confer with the parties of the Riksdag and propose a new Prime Minister, who must be tolerated by a majority of the Riksdag. If the Prime Minister has resigned or lost a vote of confidence, he or she will remain the head of a government \"ad interim\" until the new Prime Minister assumes his or her office. The only case where the governmental line of succession becomes relevant is when the Prime Minister dies (upon which the person next in the line of succession serves as the head of a government \"ad interim\") or when the Prime Minister is on leave or for any other reason incapable of serving, but still remains in office. This might be compared to the Presidential line of succession in the United States, where the person next in line assumes the Presidency throughout the remainder of the term if the President dies, resigns or is impeached.\n\n[Edward St John] Edward Henry St John QC (pr: Sinj'n) (15 August 191624 October 1994) was a prominent Australian barrister, anti-nuclear activist and Liberal politician in the 1960s.

        "body_text": "Context:\n[Apollo (spacecraft)] The Apollo spacecraft was composed of three parts designed to accomplish the American Apollo program's goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by the end of the 1960s and returning them safely to Earth. The expendable (single-use) spacecraft consisted of a combined Command/Service Module (CSM) and a Lunar Module (LM). Two additional components complemented the spacecraft stack for space vehicle assembly: a Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) designed to shield the LM from the aerodynamic stress of launch and to connect the CSM to the Saturn launch vehicle; and a Launch Escape System (LES) to carry the crew in the Command Module safely away from the launch vehicle in the event of a launch emergency.\n\n[Moon Machines] Moon Machines in the US and UK is a Science Channel HD documentary miniseries consisting of six episodes documenting the engineering challenges of the Apollo Program to land a man on the Moon. It covers everything from the iconic Saturn V to the Command Module, the Lunar Module, the Space Suits, the Guidance and Control Computer, and the Lunar Rover. It was created by the team who made \"In the Shadow of the Moon\" in association with NASA to commemorate the agency's fiftieth anniversary in 2008. It first aired in June 2008 and was released on DVD a year later in June 2009.\n\n[Apollo 8] Apollo 8, the second human spaceflight mission in the United States Apollo space program, was launched on December 21, 1968, and became the first crewed spacecraft to leave Earth orbit, reach the Earth's Moon, orbit it and return safely to Earth. The three-astronaut crew — Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot James Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders — became the first humans to: travel beyond low Earth orbit; escape Earth's gravity; see Earth as a whole planet; enter the gravity well of another celestial body (Earth's moon); orbit another celestial body (Earth's moon); directly see the far side of the Moon with their own eyes; witness an Earthrise; escape the gravity of another celestial body (Earth's moon); and re-enter the gravitational well of Earth. The 1968 mission, the third flight of the Saturn V rocket and that rocket's first crewed launch, was also the first human spaceflight launch from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, located adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\n[Apollo 12] Apollo 12 was the sixth manned flight in the United States Apollo program and the second to land on the Moon (an H type mission). It was launched on November 14, 1969, from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, four months after Apollo 11. Mission commander Charles \"Pete\" Conrad and Lunar Module Pilot Alan L. Bean performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while Command Module Pilot Richard F. Gordon remained in lunar orbit. The landing site for the mission was located in the southeastern portion of the Ocean of Storms.\n\n[Apollo 16] Apollo 16 was the tenth manned mission in the United States Apollo space program, the fifth and penultimate to land on the Moon and the first to land in the lunar highlands. The second of the so-called \"J missions,\" it was crewed by Commander John Young, Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke and Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly. Launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972, the mission lasted 11 days, 1 hour, and 51 minutes, and concluded at 2:45 PM EST on April 27.\n\n[Moon tree] Moon trees are trees grown from 500 seeds taken into orbit around the Moon by Stuart Roosa during the Apollo 14 mission in 1971. As the Command Module Pilot on the Apollo 14 mission, and because he was a former smoke jumper, Roosa was contacted by Ed Cliff, who was the Chief of the Forest Service at the time, and who proposed the idea of taking the seeds along. Seeds for the experiment were chosen from five different types of trees: Loblolly Pine, Sycamore, Sweetgum, Redwood, and Douglas Fir.\n\n[Stuart Roosa] Stuart Allen \"Stu\" Roosa (August 16, 1933 – December 12, 1994), (Col, USAF), was an American aeronautical engineer, United States Air Force pilot, test pilot, and NASA astronaut, who was the Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 14 mission. The mission lasted from January 31 to February 9, 1971 and was the third mission to land astronauts (Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell) on the Moon. While Shepard and Mitchell spent two days on the lunar surface, Roosa conducted experiments from orbit in the Command Module \"Kitty Hawk\". He was one of only 24 people to travel to the Moon.\n\n[AS-201] AS-201 (or SA-201), flown February 26, 1966, was the first unmanned test flight of an entire production Block I Apollo Command/Service Module and the Saturn IB launch vehicle. The spacecraft consisted of the second Block I command module and the first Block I service module. The suborbital flight was a partially successful demonstration of the service propulsion system and the reaction control systems of both modules, and successfully demonstrated the capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive re-entry from low Earth orbit.\n\n[Lunex Project] The Lunex Project was a US Air Force 1958 plan for a manned lunar landing prior to the Apollo Program. The final lunar expedition plan in 1961 was for a 21-airman underground Air Force base on the Moon by 1968 at a total cost of $7.5 billion. The primary distinction between the later Apollo missions and Lunex was the orbital rendezvous maneuver. The Lunex vehicle, composed of a landing module and a lifting body return/re-entry module, would land the entire vehicle and all astronauts on the surface, whereas the final Apollo mission involved a separate ascent module leaving the command module and service module connected in lunar orbit with a single astronaut. The original plan for Apollo was for direct ascent, similar to Lunex.\n\n[Apollo 9] Apollo 9 was the third manned mission in the United States Apollo space program and the first flight of the Command/Service Module (CSM) with the Lunar Module (LM, pronounced \"lem\"). Its three-person crew, consisting of Commander James McDivitt, Command Module Pilot David Scott, and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart, spent ten days in low Earth orbit testing several aspects critical to landing on the Moon, including the LM engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems, and docking maneuvers. The mission was the second manned launch of a Saturn V rocket.\n\nQuestion: In the NASA mission where Moon trees were taken into space, what was the nickname of the Command Module?",

However, between 1977 and 2007, the film industry of Pakistan went into decline due to Islamization, strengthening of censorship laws and an overall lack of quality. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the film industry went through several periods of ups and downs, a reflection of its dependency on state funding and incentives. By 2000, the film industry in Lahore had collapsed and saw a gradual shift of Pakistani actors, actresses, producers and filmmakers from Lahore to Karachi. By 2007, the wounds of Pakistan's collapsed film industry began to heal and Karachi had cemented itself as the centre of Pakistani cinema. Quality and new technology led to an explosion of alternative form of Pakistani cinema. The shift has been seen by many as the leading cause for the \"resurgence of Pakistani cinema\". Despite the industry crisis starting in the mid-1980s, Pakistani films have retained much of its distinctive identity. Since the shift to Karachi, Pakistani films have once again began attracting a strong cult following.\n\n[Cinema of Quebec] The history of cinema in Quebec started on June 27, 1896 when the Frenchman Louis Minier inaugurated the first movie projection in North America in a Montreal theatre room.

The British Royal Navy pioneered the first aircraft carrier as floatplanes, as flying boats under performed compared to traditional land based aircraft. The first true aircraft carrier was the HMS \"Argus\" , launched in late 1917 with a complement of 20 aircraft, a flight deck of 550 ft and 68 ft wide. The last aircraft carrier sunk in wartime was the Japanese carrier \"Amagi\", in Kure Harbour in July 1945.

The poetic form consists of a multi-lined strophic verse poem written in classical Arabic, usually consisting of five stanzas, alternating with a refrain with a running rhyme. It was customary to open with one or two lines which matched the second part of the poem in rhyme and meter; in North Africa poets ignore the strict rules of Arabic meter while the poets in the East follow them. The musical genre of the same name uses \"muwaššaḥ\" texts as lyrics, still in classical Arabic. This tradition can take two forms: the \"waṣla\" of Aleppo and the Andalusi \"nubah\" of the western part of the Arab world.\n\n[Crossing the Water] Crossing the Water is a 1971 posthumous collection of poetry by Sylvia Plath that was prepared for publication by Ted Hughes.

Plath died by suicide a month after its first UK publication. The novel was published under Plath's name for the first time in 1967 and was not published in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of both Plath's husband, Ted Hughes, and her mother.

The latter two were both, at the time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare films. Cukor featured the mature actors Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard as the teenage lovers while Zeffirelli populated his film with beautiful young people, and Baz Luhrmann produced a heavily cut fast-paced version aimed at teenage audiences.\n\n[Romeo] Romeo Montague (Italian: \"Romeo Montecchi\" ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".

This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language, seen underlined below. This scene is called the balcony scene by many people. Juliet not only makes the statement above but compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he wasn't named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's Love. Also as said before this states that if he wasn't Romeo, then he wouldn't be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all.\n\n[List of Romeo × Juliet episodes] \"Romeo × Juliet\" (ロミオ×ジュリエット , Romio to Jurietto ) is a 24-episode anime television adaptation of \"Romeo and Juliet\", a 16th-century tragedy originally written by William Shakespeare.

Rotrou was from the House of Châteaudun and descended from the Viscounts of Châteaudun. His mother was a sister of Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury. Patrick’s sister Sibyll married John FitzGilbert, the Marshal of the Horses, whose son Henry was Bishop of Exeter and a knight in the service of Rotrou.\n\n[Crabbet Arabian Stud] The Crabbet Arabian Stud, also known as the Crabbet Park Stud, was a horse breeding farm established on 2 July 1878 when the first Arabian horses brought to England by Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt arrived at Crabbet Park, their estate in Sussex. Six months earlier, while staying in Aleppo, Wilfrid and Lady Anne had made a plan to import some of the best Arabian horses to England and breed them there. In Lady Anne's words, \"it would be an interesting and useful thing to do and I should like much to try it.\"\n\n[Rotrou III, Count of Perche] Rotrou III (bef. 1080 – [20 January/6 May] 1144), called the Great (\"le Grand\"), was the Count of Perche and Mortagne from 1099. He was the son of Geoffrey II, Count of Perch, and Beatrix de Ramerupt, daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier. He was a notable Crusader and a participant in the \"Reconquista\" in eastern Spain, even ruling the city of Tudela in Navarre from 1123 to 1131. He is commonly credited with introducing Arabian horses to the Perche, giving rise to the Percheron breed. By his creation of a monastery at La Trappe in memory of his wife, Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England, in 1122 he also laid the foundations of the later Trappists.\n\n[German Warmblood] German Warmblood may refer generally to any of the various warmblood horses of Germany, or more specifically to a warmblood registered with the nationwide German Horse Breeding Society (ZfDP). Beneath the umbrella term \"German warmblood\" are several regional variations on a singular standard; individual German warmblood types are not necessarily considered \"breeds\", because they have an open stud book and freely exchange genetic material between each other, with other warmblood types, with Anglo-Arabians, and with breeds like the Thoroughbred, Arabian, and Trakehner. (The Trakehner, while a warmblood horse from Germany, has a closed stud book and thus, like the Thoroughbred and Arabian, is considered a \"true\" breed.)\n\n[Bardigiano] The Bardigiano is a breed of small horse from the Emilia Romagna region of Italy. It takes its name from the town of Bardi, in the Apennines of Parma, and is principally associated with the surrounding area and the Valle del Ceno. The mountain environment and steep, rough terrain of the area have contributed to produce a robust, hardy breed, agile and sure-footed over difficult ground. Although some males and all females are under  hands , the Bardigiano is always considered a horse in its home country. The stud book was established in 1977, and is held by the Associazione Provinciale Allevatori, the regional animal breeders' association, of Parma. The breed is widely distributed in Italy, with breeders in 26 Italian provinces; a recent study examined 3556 stud book entries for living horses. Due to these relatively large numbers, the breed is not considered to be at risk of extinction, but is classed as \"vulnerable\".\n\n[French Saddle Pony] The French Saddle Pony, also called the Poney Français de Selle, is pony breed developed as a sport pony for children and smaller adult riders. It was initially developed in 1969 as the Poney de Croisement (Cross-bred Pony), and in 1972 a stud book was created. In 1991 the stud book was closed and the breed renamed to Poney Français de Selle. The breed combines a mix of French and British pony breeds, as well as Thoroughbred and Arabian blood, to create the horse seen today. Due to the large number of breeds used to create the French Saddle Pony, there is not yet a defined set of physical characteristics for the breed, although all tend to be suited for competition in English riding disciplines, including dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing. They fill a similar role as the British Riding Pony and the German riding pony.\n\n[Purosangue Orientale] The Purosangue Orientale or Puro Sangue Orientale (PSO) (en: “Oriental Purebred”), is a horse breed developed in the Kingdom of Italy by Royal Decree n° 2690 of 19 September 1875, which created a stud book dedicated to the breed. Beginning in 1864, the Italian Government had sent emissaries into Syria and Mesopotamia to purchase desert bred Arabian horses directly from Bedouin tribes. Numerous stallions and mares were purchased and brought back to Sicily, many being destined for the Royal Remount Station in Catania.\n\n[Sella Italiano] Sella Italiano is an equine breed created in Italy. The Italian Government has passed a law that created a stud book for the new breed. The breed is blending the remnant indigenous Italian breeds of Maremmano, Salernitano and Persano horse with Anglo Arabo Sardo, Purosangue Orientale, Arabian and Thoroughbred. The progeny of said horses can be registered as Sella Italiano if they can pass a “performance test”. Furthermore, the stud book is open to other European warmbloods if they can pass the performance test and be approved by the breed registry. The breed is intended to produce a sport horse which can compete successfully at the international level.\n\n[Yeguada Militar de Jerez de la Frontera] Yeguada Militar de Jerez de la Frontera, (en: \"Military Stud of de Jerez de la Frontera\") known outside Spain as the Yeguada Militar is the military Spanish stud farm headquartered in Andalusia, Spain, dedicated to horse breeding of purebred Andalusian horses and Arabian horses. Founded in 1847, it became the state military stud farm in 1893. In the 20th century, as need for cavalry horses declined, the stud's emphasis shifted to become a genetic reservoir to preserve the bloodlines of the Pure Spanish Horse and to continue to breed high quality Arabian horses, with stallions of both breeds being made available to private horse breeders to improve the horses of Spain. Today, there are two facilities located in the Jerez de la Frontera area, one primarily for stallions, the other for mares and foals, as well as multiple stallion depots across the country.\n\n[Percheron] The Percheron is a breed of draft horse that originated in the Huisne river valley in western France, part of the former Perche province from which the breed takes its name. Usually gray or black in color, Percherons are well muscled, and known for their intelligence and willingness to work. Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed were present in the valley by the 17th century. They were originally bred for use as war horses. Over time, they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Arabian blood was added to the breed. Exports of Percherons from France to the United States and other countries rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron stud book was created in France in 1883.\n\nQuestion: When was the first stud book created for the breed of horse that came from Rotrou introducing Arabian horses to Perche?",

The song failed to hit the Top 40 of the pop chart (peaking at #42) and reached #11 on Cashbox's R&B singles chart (the \"Billboard\" R&B chart was suspended until January 1965).\n\nQuestion: Live Wire Radio will possibly be considered as a replacement for a variety show created in what year?",

He established The Public Theater in what had been the Astor Library Building in lower Manhattan. There, Papp created a year-round producing home to focus on new plays and musicals. Among numerous examples of these were the works of David Rabe, Ntozake Shange's \"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf\", Charles Gordone's \"No Place to Be Somebody\" (the first off-Broadway play to win the Pulitzer Prize), and Papp's production of Michael Bennett's Pulitzer Prize–winning musical, \"A Chorus Line\". Papp also founded Shakespeare in the Park, helped to develop other off-Broadway theatres and worked to preserve the historic Broadway Theatre District.\n\n[The Sound of a Voice] The Sound of a Voice is a 1983 play by American playwright David Henry Hwang. Hwang's fifth play, it is an original ghost story inspired by Japanese folk stories, films, and Noh theater.

It was directed by and featured John Lone.\n\n[Foundation for Ethnic Understanding] The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding (FFEU) is a not-for-profit organization based in New York that focuses on improving Muslim–Jewish relations and black–Jewish relations. FFEU was founded in 1989 by Rabbi Marc Schneier and theatrical producer and director Joseph Papp. The goals of the organization are in part motivated by the historical cooperation between African Americans and Jewish Americans during the Civil Rights Movement. Russell Simmons joined the Board of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding in 2002 as Chairman of the Board. In 2007, the Foundation began its program in Muslim–Jewish Relations and has since hosted the First National Summit of Imams and Rabbis, two European conferences of Muslim and Jewish Leaders, three Missions of Muslim and Jewish Leaders to Washington D.C., and has held the annual program \"The Weekend of Twinning\" each November since 2008.\n\n[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)] Shakespeare in the Park (or Free Shakespeare in the Park) is a theatrical program that stages productions of Shakespearean plays at the Delacorte Theater, an open-air theater in New York City's Central Park. The theater and the productions are managed by the Public Theater and tickets are distributed free of charge on the day of the performance. Originally branded as the New York Shakespeare Festival (NYSF) under the direction of Joseph Papp, the institution was renamed in 2002 as part of a larger reorganization by the Public Theater.\n\n[More Than You Deserve] More Than You Deserve is a musical written by Jim Steinman and Michael Weller, produced by Joseph Papp and directed by Kim Friedman. It opened at The Public Theater on November 21, 1973, ran for 63 performances and closed on January 13, 1974. Weller's original title for the play was \"Souvenirs\", which referred to the severed ears of killed Viet Cong forces which the soldiers collected and wore as keepsakes on strings around their necks. He was irate when the title was changed to \"More Than You Deserve\".\n\n[Joe's Pub] Joe's Pub, one of the six performance spaces within The Public Theater, is a music venue and restaurant that hosts live performances across genres and arts, ranging from cabaret to modern dance to world music.

The film, starring Kevin Kline, Angela Lansbury, Linda Ronstadt, George Rose, and Rex Smith, is an adaptation of the 1980 Joseph Papp production of \"Pirates\". The original Broadway cast reprised their roles in the film, except that Lansbury replaced Estelle Parsons as Ruth. The minor roles used British actors miming to their Broadway counterparts. Choreography was by Graciela Daniele. It was produced by Papp and filmed at Shepperton Studios in London.\n\n[Organic Theater Company] Organic Theater Company, a Chicago theatre, was founded in 1969 in Madison, Wisconsin by artistic director Stuart Gordon and his wife Carolyn Purdy Gordon. Its first play was a production of \"Richard III\" but harassment from the local officials of Madison caused the production to be moved to three different venues before closing. In 1970 at the invitation of Paul Sills, Organic moved to Chicago where Sills helped the theater find a home in the Holy Covenant Church where they produced original adaptations of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" and Homer's \"Odyssey\". When Sills took his production of Story Theater to Los Angeles that summer he invited Organic to produce at his Body Politic Theater on Lincoln Avenue. The company ended up staying there over three years where it produced \"Candide\" which was invited by Joseph Papp to the Public Theater in New York. They also produced \"Poe\" by playwright Stephen Most and \"Warp!\" by Stuart Gordon and Bury St. Edmund aka Lenny Kleinfeld, an original science-fiction epic adventure in three parts. \"Warp!\" was produced on Broadway at the Ambassador Theater in 1973.\n\n[Curse of the Starving Class] Curse of the Starving Class is a play by Sam Shepard, considered the first of a series on family tragedies. Some critics consider it part of a Family Trilogy that includes \"Buried Child\" (1979) and \"True West\" (1980). Others consider it part of a quintet that includes \"Fool for Love\" (1983) and \"A Lie of the Mind\" (1985). The play was commissioned by Joseph Papp and premiered in London in 1977 before playing at Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival in 1978.\n\n[Eulalie Spence] Eulalie Spence (June 11, 1894 – March 7, 1981) was a black writer, teacher, director, actress and playwright from the British West Indies. She was an influential member of the Harlem Renaissance, writing fourteen plays, at least five of which were published. Spence, who described herself as a \"folk dramatist\" who made plays for fun and entertainment, was considered one of the most experienced female playwrights before the 1950s, and received more recognition than other black playwrights of the Harlem Renaissance period, winning several competitions. She presented several plays with W.E.B. Du Bois' Krigwa Players, of which she was a member from 1926 to 1928. Spence was also a mentor to theatrical producer Joseph Papp, founder of The Public Theater and the accompanying festival currently known as Shakespeare in the Park.\n\nQuestion: What was the original name of the theatrical program that was founded by Joseph Papp?

The character may be identified as a diagnosed/assessed psychopath or sociopath within the fictional work itself, or by its creator when discussing their intentions with the work, which might be distinguished from opinions of audiences or critics based only on a character appearing to show traits or behaviors associated with an undefined popular stereotype of psychopathy.\n\n[Tommy Carcetti] Thomas J. \"Tommy\" Carcetti ( ) is a fictional character on the HBO drama \"The Wire\", played by Aidan Gillen. Carcetti is an ambitious Baltimore politician who begins the series with a seat on the city council.\n\n[Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School] Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School (SJCBS) was a school that was located in Selkirk, Manitoba. It was founded in the early 1960s by Ted Byfield and Frank Wiens. The two started an Anglican lay order called the Company of the Cross, claimed to be based on a reading of some of C.S. Lewis's writings. The Company of the Cross was under the authority of the resident bishop in Winnipeg, officially called the Diocese of Rupert's Land. The teachers were paid $1.00 per day and provided room and board. Two other schools, Saint John's School of Alberta and Saint John's School of Ontario were founded on the same ideas in later years. Arduous row-boat trips (called \"cutters\"), later replaced by canoes, and snowshoeing and dog-sledding were part of the outdoor education program. The school's founders believed that boys should be pushed to what they might believe is their breaking points, and this would \"build character\". The school was seen by many as a way to help troubled boys, usually from 11 to 14 years of age. Its primary focus was challenging boys from every social stratum to work together in order to grow morally, physically, intellectually and spiritually in the tradition of Victorian \"muscular Christianity\".\n\n[Yossarian] Capt. John Yossarian is a fictional character, the protagonist of Joseph Heller's satirical novel \"Catch-22\" and its sequel \"Closing Time\". In \"Catch-22\", Yossarian might be a 28-year-old captain in the 256th squadron of the Army Air Forces where he could serve as a B-25 bombardier stationed on the small island of Pianosa off the Italian mainland during World War II. Yossarian's exploits are based on the experiences of the author: Heller was also a bombardier in the Army Air Corps, stationed on an island off the coast of Italy during World War II.\n\n[Direct from Brooklyn] Direct from Brooklyn is a compilation of music videos by American alternative rock group They Might Be Giants. It was released on VHS in 1999 and DVD in 2003. The title refers to the home of John Linnell and John Flansburgh, founding members of the band. Many of the music videos were filmed in Brooklyn and other parts of New York City.\n\n[The Mundanes] Marsha Armitage was the lead vocalist. The band was initially based in Providence (several of the band members attended Brown University) and played locally in the Boston-Providence area. The band generated tremendous energy and had a devoted following, but struggled to sign to a record label. In 1981, the band relocated to New York City. Shortly thereafter, John Linnell left the band to pursue another musical project, They Might Be Giants, with John Flansburgh. Drummer Kevin Tooley was replaced by Peter Clemente, and Jim Gillson replaced John Linnell on keyboards. The band continued to gig in New England and played frequently in New York City venues, including CBGB. David Hemmings, who had previously managed Pat Travers and Ozzy Osbourne, took on the band's management. They recorded a demo at RCA Studios, produced by Mick Ronson, that attracted record label attention, but the band remained unsigned and ultimately broke up in mid-1983.\n\n[Perseus] Because of the obscurity of the name Perseus and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus’ native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the Proto-Indo-European language. In that regard Robert Graves has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb, \"πέρθειν\" (\"perthein\"), “to waste, ravage, sack, destroy”, some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to Carl Darling Buck (\"Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin\"), the \"–eus\" suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the aorist stem, \"pers-\". \"Pers-eus\" therefore is a sacker of cities; that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\n[Khirbet Qeiyafa] Khirbet Qeiyafa (Elah Fortress; Hirbet Kaifeh) is the site of an ancient fortress city overlooking the Elah Valley. The ruins of the fortress were uncovered in 2007, near the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh, 30 km from Jerusalem. It covers nearly 2.5 ha and is encircled by a 700-meter-long (2,300 ft) city wall constructed of stones weighing up to eight tons each. A number of archaeologists, mainly Yosef Garfinkel and Saar Ganor, have claimed that it might be the biblical city of Sha'arayim, because of the two gates discovered on the site, or Neta'im and that the large building at the center is an administrative building dating to the reign of King David, where he might have lodged at some point. this is based on their conclusions that the site dates to the early Iron IIA, ca. 1025–975 BCE, a range which includes the biblical date for the Kingdom of David. Others are sceptical, and suggest it might represent either a North Israelite, Philistine or Canaanite fortress. The techniques and interpretations used to reach the conclusion that Khirbet Qeiyafa was a fortress of King David have been criticised.\n\n[Lincoln (album)] Lincoln is the second album by the band They Might Be Giants. It was released by Bar/None in 1988. The album is named after the capital city of Lincoln, Nebraska and John Linnell and John Flansburgh's boyhood home of Lincoln, Massachusetts. The album produced three singles — \"Ana Ng\", \"They'll Need a Crane\", and \"Purple Toupee\". It is included on \"\", a compilation of the band's early material, in its entirety.\n\n[John Capozzi] John James Capozzi, Jr. (D) served as the second District of Columbia Shadow U.S. Representative, during 1995-1997 and is a former 17 year at-large member of the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee. He ran as a Candidate to become an At-Large Councilmember on the Council of the District of Columbia and was defeated September 10, 1996. Capozzi is considered the possible inspiration for the character Tommy Carcetti in the HBO drama \"The Wire\". He previously worked for BRMi Consulting as a Recruitment Manager.

Rory tends to write the melody, and Calum the lyrics. Since former lead singer Donnie Munro left the band in 1997, Rory has taken lead vocal duties on songs in the band's catalogue written in the Scottish Gaelic language, as the band's new lead singer, Bruce Guthro, is not a Gaelic speaker.\n\n[Steve Hogarth] Steve Hogarth (born on 14 May 1956 in Kendal, Westmorland) also known as \"h\", is an English singer-songwriter and musician. Since 1989 he has been the lead vocalist and occasional keyboardist/guitarist with the British rock band Marillion.

The title means 'of the sea' in Scots Gaelic. It is the last album featuring Donnie Munro on vocals and the fifth and final album released on Chrysalis records.\n\n[Easter (Marillion song)] Easter is a song from English neo-progressive rock band Marillion's 1989 album \"Seasons End\", which became a UK Top 40 hit when issued as a single in 1990. Allmusic describe the song as \"heartfelt\" with an \"imaginative electric-acoustic arrangement\". As with many Marillion songs, the album version features an extended guitar solo by Steve Rothery, which has become a fan-favourite, although it is heavily edited for the single version. The song was written by singer Steve Hogarth before he joined the band in 1989 and was inspired by The Troubles in Northern Ireland. The title is in reference to Easter 1916 by William Butler Yeats. Portions of the video were filmed on the Giants Causeway.\n\n[A Singles Collection] A Singles Collection (released as Six of One, Half-Dozen of the Other in the U.S.) is a compilation album of Marillion singles from both the Fish era and the Steve Hogarth era, celebrating the band's ten year jubilee (taking 1982, when their debut single was released, as the starting point). It includes the band's six most successful singles of the Fish era, plus all six Steve Hogarth singles up to that year. The tracks on it are not ordered chronologically, unlike on the later compilations \"The Best of Both Worlds\" (1997) and \"The Best of Marillion\" (2003) that likewise cover both vocalists' eras. Additionally, it contains two new recordings with Hogarth on vocals, \"I Will Walk On Water\" and a cover version of the Rare Bird song \"Sympathy\". This was also released as a single, which peaked at no. 16 in the UK Singles Chart (May 1992), making it the band's highest charting single between 1987 and 2004. In August 1992, \"No One Can\", a re-packaged version of the August 1991 single from \"Holidays in Eden\", was released as the second single, peaking at no. 26 (original version no. 33).\n\n[The Best of Both Worlds (Marillion album)] Best of Both Worlds is a two-disc compilation album by British neo-progressive rock band Marillion released in 1997 by EMI Records, who the band had been signed to from their debut in 1982 until being dropped in 1995. The title refers to Marillion's two distinct \"eras\" with lead singers Fish (1980—1988) and Steve Hogarth (since 1989). By the time this compilation was released, both line-ups had recorded four studio albums each. The second best-of since the 14-track one-disc compilation \"A Singles Collection\" (known as \"Six of One, Half a Dozen of the Other \"in the US) from 1992, this one additionally contains material from \"Brave \"(1994) and \"Afraid of Sunlight\" (1996). Two different covers were created for the compilation, one by Mark Wilkinson, who had worked for the band during the Fish years, and one by Bill Smith Studio, who took over after Fish's and Wilkinson's departure. The booklet was printed so that either of the covers could be displayed in the jewel case according to personal preference. The track list, comprising 29 songs, was put together by Lucy Jordache, then the manager responsible for the band in EMI, in close collaboration with the band's fans' mailing list, \"Freaks\" (named after the eponymous song). Jordache also motivated singers Fish and Hogarth to contribute liner notes—at a time when both camps were not yet on friendly terms again—by telling each of them the other had already agreed to do so.\n\nQuestion: Who was born first, Steve Hogarth or Donnie Munro?",

Beginning in 1895, the novel was republished with the heading \"I Romanzi della Rosa\" (the Novels of the Rose), forming a narrative cycle including \"The Intruder\" (\"The Victim,\" in America), and \"Triumph of Death.\"\n\n[Timeline of Mary Wollstonecraft] The lifetime of British writer, philosopher, and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797) encompassed most of the second half of the eighteenth century, a time of great political and social upheaval throughout Europe and America: political reform movements in Britain gained strength, the American colonists successfully rebelled, and the French revolution erupted. Wollstonecraft experienced only the headiest of these days, not living to see the end of the democratic revolution when Napoleon crowned himself emperor. Although Britain was still revelling in its mid-century imperial conquests and its triumph in the Seven Years' War, it was the French revolution that defined Wollstonecraft's generation. As poet Robert Southey later wrote: \"few persons but those who have lived in it can conceive or comprehend what the memory of the French Revolution was, nor what a visionary world seemed to open upon those who were just entering it. Old things seemed passing away, and nothing was dreamt of but the regeneration of the human race.\"\n\n[Triumph of the Will] Triumph of the Will (German: Triumph des Willens ) is a 1935 German propaganda film directed, produced, edited, and co-written by Leni Riefenstahl. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, which was attended by more than 700,000 Nazi supporters. The film contains excerpts from speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and public reaction. Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. The film's overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power, with Hitler as the leader who will bring glory to the nation. Because the film was made after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives (on 30 June) many prominent Sturmabteilung (SA) members are absent—they were murdered in that Party purge, organised and orchestrated by Hitler to replace the SA with the Schutzstaffel (SS) as his main paramilitary force.\n\n[Anna Aglatova] Anna Khachaturovna Aglatova (Russian: Анна Хачатуровна Аглатова ) is a Russian soprano singer who was born in Kislovodsk and by 2004 joined the singing department of the Gnessin State Musical College.

In its end of the year round-up of regional British fringe musical theatre, \"Musical Theatre Review\" hailed \"Love Birds\": \"a triumph of whimsy, a children’s story written with adult sensibilities and featuring a cracking score that celebrated the lost era of vaudeville. Blessed with an equally strong design from Gabriella Slade and some marvellously sensitive performances, Love Birds was probably the most accomplished piece of musical theatre to arise from the many delights at this year’s festival.\"\n\n[Escape Tour] The Escape Tour was a concert tour by the American rock band Journey.

The team nearly went winless for the season, but on December 16, the third to last game of the regular season, they beat the Baltimore Ravens, giving them a final record of 1–15. The Detroit Lions became the first team to go 0–16 the following season. Their only win of the season gave them the first pick in the 2008 NFL draft. They also failed to improve upon a 6–10 season in 2006. Under former head coach Nick Saban in a year that began with high hopes, Saban resigned from the Dolphins to become the head coach at the University of Alabama, after repeatedly saying he would stay with the Dolphins. The Dolphins entered 2007 in the process of rebuilding under new head coach Cam Cameron, the former offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers. The coaching staff underwent significant changes, with approximately twelve coaches newly hired or reassigned. Cameron also made various changes to the team's roster, with more than a dozen players being added or re-signed and just as many being released, traded or allowed to sign elsewhere. Six of the team's losses in 2007 were by margins of three points or less.\n\n[1995 New York Jets season] The 1995 New York Jets season was the 36th season for the team and the 26th in the National Football League. The Jets entered the 1995 season with their third different head coach in as many years as former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Rich Kotite was hired to replace Pete Carroll, who was fired after posting a 6–10 record in his only season as Jets head coach. Kotite did not have any success in his first year, as the team finished 3–13. The 13 losses set a team record, while the 3 wins were the fewest of any Jets team since 1977, when the team completed their third consecutive 3–11 season.\n\n[2008–09 Phoenix Suns season] The 2008–09 Phoenix Suns season was the 41st season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The season was to be a promising one, filled with All-Star talent at several positions. It was believed over the offseason, the Suns would be able to better incorporate Shaquille O'Neal, who necessitated changes to both the offense and defense after being obtained in a trade one season ago. It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock. Sensing a need for change, team management traded for scorer Jason Richardson in December, but this did not appear to immediately reinvigorate an offense that had recently led the league in points per game. However, after Phoenix went 28–23 to start the season, Suns assistant Alvin Gentry was named to replace Porter as head coach. Less than one week after the All-Star Game, Amar'e Stoudemire sustained a season-ending eye injury while the improvement of the team never fully came. The Suns finished 46–36, second in the Pacific division but out the playoffs for the first time since Steve Nash rejoined the Suns in the 2004–05 season.\n\n[Neil Lennon] Neil Francis Lennon (born 25 June 1971) is a Northern Irish football coach and former player, who is the head coach of Scottish Premiership club Hibernian.\n\n[1977 New York Jets season] The 1977 New York Jets season was the 18th season for the team and the 8th in the National Football League. It began with the team trying to improve upon its 3–11 record from 1976 under new head coach Walt Michaels and beginning the post-Joe Namath era. However, the Jets struggled with their third consecutive 3-11 season. They won a major off the field court decision. As per the memorandum of understanding signed in late 1961 by team original owner (as the New York Titans) Harry Wismer, Shea Stadium's co-tenants, the New York Mets, would have exclusive use of the stadium until they had completed their season. The Jets were, in most years, required to open the season with several road games, a problem made worse in 1969 and 1973 when the Mets had long playoff runs. Feeling that this arrangement was a disadvantage, the team announced in 1977 that they would play two home games a year during the month of September at the Giants' new home in New Jersey, Giants Stadium. Litigation began between New York City and the Jets over the issue, and in the lawsuit's settlement, the city agreed to allow the Jets to play two September home games a season at Shea beginning in 1978 for the remaining six years in the Jets' lease. In 1977, the Jets were to play one September game at Giants Stadium and an October 2 game at Shea. From 1967 through this season—a span of 11 seasons—the Jets did not play a home game at Shea Stadium in the month of September. As of 2017, the Jets are the first (and so far, only) team in NFL history to finish 3 straight seasons with only 3 wins. Since the NFL schedule expanded to 16 games in 1978, no team has finished 3-13 3 years in a row.\n\n[Pieter Huistra] Pieter Egge Huistra (] , born 18 January 1967) is a Dutch football coach and former winger, who currently serves as assistant manager at Pakhtakor Tashkent FK in Uzbekistan.

In 2001, he began coaching as the Head Coach for Jong Groningen. He was with them for four years before being named assistant coach of Aad de Mos at Vitesse. He then became an assistant coach with AFC Ajax and was named as their Head Coach on April 24, 2009. He was then the head coach of FC Groningen for the 2010–11 season. On May 30, 2012 he then became the head coach of the Eerste Divisie club De Graafschap. Finally, on December 3, 2014 he was appointed as the Technical Director of the Indonesia national football team.\n\n[Lisa Ryckbosch] Lisa Ryckbosch is the current director of Professional, Corporate & Community Relations at DePaul University. She previously served as the head coach of the UIC Flames women's basketball team from 2002 to 2011 and holds the record for most wins in UIC women's basketball history. In her fifth season as head coach, the Flames made their first post-season appearance in the WNIT following their best-ever finish in the Horizon League. Upon completion of the 2010–11 season, her record with the flames was 128–139. Ryckbosch came to UIC after eleven seasons as an assistant coach at Depaul, from 1991 until 2002, and one season as an assistant coach at UIC from 1990 to 1991. Ryckbosch graduated from Loyola in 1984 after starting for the Ramblers for four years and serving as a team captain for two seasons, and in 2006 was inducted in Loyola's Athletics Hall of Fame. After graduation she began her coaching career at Hillcrest High School in Country Club Hills, Illinois, where she served as the Head Girls' Varsity Basketball Coach and a math teacher for three years.\n\n[2015 Buffalo Bills season] The 2015 Buffalo Bills season was the franchise’s 56th overall season as a football team, 46th in the National Football League, third under leadership of general manager Doug Whaley and first under new head coach Rex Ryan, who signed a five-year, $27.5 million contract on January 12, 2015 after having previously spent the past six seasons coaching the division-rival New York Jets, leading them to two straight AFC Championship games in 2009 and 2010, becoming the franchise’s 18th head coach and the fifth in the past seven years in the process. Ryan replaced Doug Marrone, who opted out of his contract on December 31, 2014 to take advantage of a contract loophole, fearing the Pegulas were going to fire him, hence the reason the Bills entered the 2015 season looking for a new head coach. Despite the bold prediction made by Ryan at his introductory press conference, where he stated, “I’m not going to let our fans down. I am not going to do that. I know it’s been 15 years since the Bills made the playoffs. Well, get ready, man, we’re going. We are going,” the Bills were unable to make the playoffs in their first season with Ryan as head coach, finishing with a record of 8-8 (the team’s first since 2002), making it the 16th straight season without a playoff appearance, which became the longest active in major professional sports after Major League Baseball’s Toronto Blue Jays broke their 22-year playoff drought on September 25, 2015. It was also the first full season under the ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula (whom also own the Buffalo Sabres), having purchased the Bills partway through 2014 after the death of longtime owner Ralph Wilson in March at the age of 95. The Bills began their season with an open competition for the starting quarterback position after Kyle Orton, the starter for most of the 2014 campaign, retired during the offseason, so the team acquired free agent Tyrod Taylor, a former backup quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens, who won the competition over incumbent second-string quarterback EJ Manuel and trade acquisition Matt Cassel, the latter of whom the team later traded along with a seventh-round pick in 2017 to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in 2017.\n\n[2010–11 Celtic F.C. season] The 2010–11 season was the 122nd season of competitive football by Celtic. New manager Neil Lennon made considerable changes to the Celtic team for the 2010-11 season. He sold Aiden McGeady for a then Scottish record £9.5 million along with captain Stephen McManus and fan favourite Artur Boruc. 13 other players also left the club, this gave Lennon enough funds to re-build for the new season. He looked to sign talented, young, cheap, relatively unknown players, from smaller leagues around the world. This paid off with players such as Gary Hooper, Beram Kayal and Emilio Izaguirre all having excellent seasons and earning many plaudits. Lennon also signed several experienced players on free transfers. Charlie Mulgrew, Joe Ledley, and Daniel Majstorović all went into the first team. In addition to these Lennon also signed five other players, including Fraser Forster on loan from Newcastle who became first choice 'keeper and helped set a new SPL record for most clean sheets.\n\n[2009–10 Luton Town F.C. season] The 2009–10 season was the 124th season in the history of Luton Town Football Club. Luton's 24th-place finish in Football League Two in 2008–09 meant that the club competed in the Conference Premier for the first time in its history, and in a division outside of the Football League for the first time since the beginning of their second spell as a member in 1920. Although tipped as favourites for the title and promotion before the season had even begun, the club struggled to immediately adapt to life in the new division, ultimately costing manager Mick Harford his job. Richard Money was appointed as new manager soon after, eventually leading the club to an unbeaten run of 14 games towards the end of the season that propelled them to a second place finish in the league. However, defeat in the play-off semi-finals to York City meant Luton were to remain in the Conference for the 2010–11 season.\n\nQuestion: What team does the new manager who made considerable changes to the Celtic team for the 2010-11 season head coach for?",

        "body_text": "Context:\n[Billie Jean] \"Billie Jean\" is a song by American singer Michael Jackson. It is the second single from the singer's sixth studio album, \"Thriller\" (1982). It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by Jackson and Quincy Jones. There are contradictory claims on the meaning of the song's lyrics. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson (or one of his brothers) had fathered her twins. However, Michael Jackson stated that \"Billie Jean\" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline played by Louis Johnson, the standard drum beat heard in the beginning, the repetition of \"Billie Jean is not my lover\" towards the end of the song and Michael Jackson's vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized, though he reportedly went with the second mix as the final product.\n\n[Pipes of Peace] Pipes of Peace is the fourth studio album by English singer-songwriter Paul McCartney using his own name, released in 1983. As the follow-up to the popular \"Tug of War\", the album came close to matching the commercial success of its predecessor in Britain but peaked only at number 15 on America's \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart. While \"Pipes of Peace\" was the source of international hit singles such as \"Say Say Say\" (recorded with Michael Jackson) and the title track, the critical response to the album was less favourable than that afforded to \"Tug of War\".\n\n[Girlfriend (Paul McCartney song)] \"Girlfriend\" is a song written by Paul McCartney. McCartney thought of the song as one that Michael Jackson might like to record, and mentioned this to Jackson at a party in Hollywood. Jackson had stated in interviews with the music press in the 1970s that he was a fan of The Beatles and the chance to record a McCartney original helped to inspire his next project. However, McCartney ended up recording it himself with his band Wings, and it was issued in 1978 on the album \"London Town\". Subsequently, it was suggested by Quincy Jones as a possible track for Jackson to record for his 1979 album \"Off the Wall\". Jones was unaware that the song had been written for Jackson in the first place. Jackson's recording omitted the middle eight heard in McCartney's version. It was issued exclusively in the UK in 1980, as the fifth and final single from the \"Off the Wall\" album. This proved to be another hit single for Jackson and one of his first recordings of a Paul McCartney song.\n\n[Pipes of Peace (song)] \"Pipes of Peace\" is a song written by Paul McCartney, which was first released on his album of the same name on 31 October 1983. It was also released as a single on 5 December 1983 and reached #1 on the UK singles charts for two weeks. The Song also reached #1 on the Irish Single Charts.\n\n[This Time Around (Michael Jackson song)] \"This Time Around\" is a song by American recording artist and songwriter Michael Jackson that features the vocals from rapper The Notorious B.I.G.

The song and lyrics were written by Michael Jackson, while the music was composed by Dallas Austin, Bruce Swedien and Rene Moore. Dallas Austin and Michael Jackson produced the song, while Bruce Swedien and René Moore served as co-producers. The song's lyrics details a musician's problems with being famous and dealing with stardom. In December 1995, the track was released as a promotional single in the United States only, containing a radio edit and remixes. \"This Time Around\" had a good chart performance, having charted solely due to radio airplay throughout the country. The song received positive reviews from contemporary music critics.\n\n[The Girl Is Mine] \"The Girl Is Mine\" is a song recorded by Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. The track was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson and Quincy Jones. It was released as the first single for Jackson's sixth solo album, \"Thriller\" (1982). The song was recorded at Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, from April 14 to 16, 1982. The year before, Jackson and McCartney had recorded \"Say Say Say\" and \"The Man\" for the latter's fifth solo album, \"Pipes of Peace\" (1983). Although it was released as a single, Jackson never performed the song live.\n\n[Say Say Say] \"Say Say Say\" is a song written and performed by Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, released in 1983. The track was produced by George Martin for McCartney's album, \"Pipes of Peace\". The song was recorded during production of McCartney's 1982 \"Tug of War\" album, about a year before the release of \"The Girl Is Mine\", the pair's first duet from Jackson's album \"Thriller\" (1982).\n\n[Press to Play] Press to Play is the sixth post-Beatles studio album by the English musician Paul McCartney (outside of Wings' body of work), released in August 1986. It was McCartney's first album of entirely new music since \"Pipes of Peace\" in 1983, and his first solo album to be issued internationally by EMI following a six-year alliance with Columbia Records in the United States and Canada. Keen to re-establish himself after his poorly received 1984 musical film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\", McCartney enlisted producer Hugh Padgham to give the album a contemporary sound.\n\n[Just a Little Bit of You] \"Just a Little Bit of You\" is a song from the 1975 Michael Jackson album titled \"Forever, Michael\". The album was Jackson's fourth and was released when he was 16 years old. Produced by Brian Holland, \"Just a Little Bit of You\" became Jackson's biggest solo hit in three years reaching #23 on the U.S. Pop Singles chart and #4 on the Soul Singles chart.\n\n[Can't Let Her Get Away] \"Can’t Let Her Get Away\" is a song by Michael Jackson produced by Michael Jackson and Teddy Riley. The song is the 6th track on Jackson’s 8th studio album \"Dangerous\". It was recorded and mixed by Bruce Swedien and Teddy Riley in 1991. It was written and composed by Michael Jackson and Teddy Riley. The song is about a failing relationship between Michael and his lover. He does everything to satisfy his lover but to no avail, she breaks up with him. Michael is battling within himself throughout the song and he finally decides that he can’t let her get away. The song was re-recorded in 1993 in promote of the movie The Meteor Man.It was also released as the albm's promo single.\n\nQuestion: Who produced a song, written and performed by Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, which was included on an album titled \"Pipes of Peace\"?",

KPFA airs public news, public affairs, talk, and music programming. The station signed on-the-air April 15, 1949, as the first Pacifica Radio station and remains the flagship station of the Pacifica Radio Network. The station claims to promote cultural diversity, promote pluralistic cultural expression, contribute to a lasting understanding between individuals of all nations, races, creeds and colours.\n\n[WFAN-FM] WFAN-FM (101.9 MHz), also known as Sports Radio 66 and 101.9 FM or The Fan, is a commercial FM radio station located in New York City. The station is owned and operated by CBS Radio, and has simulcast CBS' sports radio station, WFAN 660 AM, since November 1, 2012. WFAN-FM operates within the combined CBS Radio facility in New York's West Village neighborhood, and broadcasts from a transmitter located atop the Empire State Building.\n\n[WSYY-FM] WSYY-FM (94.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week (from 4:55AM through 11:10PM ET) under the slogan, \"\"Radio With An Attitude\"\". Playing a mix of oldies/classic hits, adult contemporary, rock music, and some country crossovers, the station broadcasts an Adult Hits/Full-Service format for approximately 16 hours per day, from 6:00AM through 10:00PM ET (reserving the first and, also, the final hour of their broadcast day to \"When Radio Was\"). \"The Mountain 94.9\" carries local high school sports in season. \"The Mountain 94.9\" had also carried the complete schedule of Red Sox Baseball (from 1997 through 2015, prior to becoming a Former Affiliate in 2016, which was when Millinocket's affiliation with the Red Sox Baseball would ultimately be transferred over to co-owned WSYY-AM, thus concluding the frequent interruptions to the music on \"The Mountain 94.9\" during Baseball season). The station currently features programming from CBS Radio and carries CBS Radio News at the top of every hour (and has been an affiliate of that network for many decades). Licensed to Millinocket, Maine, United States, the station's broadcast signal serves the Central Penobscot County, Eastern Piscataquis County, and Southern Aroostook County Maine areas, and the station is licensed to serve the town of Millinocket, Maine, the very town where its studios/offices and tower site are located. The station is currently owned by Katahdin Communications, Inc. WSYY-FM originally went on the air in 1978 on 97.7 FM as WKTR, upgrading to its current facilities in 1984 on 94.9. Prior to their \"The Mountain 94.9\" branding, WSYY-FM used to be referred to as \"North Country 95\", airing a full-time Country Music format. The current format, branding, and slogan was probably adopted around March 1, 2004, when Katahdin Communications, Inc. assumed control of WSYY-FM & WSYY-AM from Katahdin Timberlands, LLC (as a result of the radio station facing increasing land disputes), initially as a short term lease agreement but the transfer of ownership ultimately became permanent. Those same land disputes would eventually lead to a loss of WSYY-FM's 23,500 watt transmitter location (featuring an antenna HAAT of 211 meters); as a result, WSYY-FM may have been operating under a Special Temporary Authority License (a 12,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 68 meters via Hammond Ridge on Lake Road, about two miles from Millinocket Municipal Airport), ever since as long ago as late 2007, pending a planned permanent move to a 22,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 198.4 meters (from just off Nicatou Road in Medway, well east of WSYY-FM's old or current transmitter tower location). On November 23th, 2016, the CP for this proposed move was modified to a 45,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 146.7 meters, the first time this proposed move has ever received official approval from the FCC. WSYY-FM is one of the two Maine affiliates—apart from WLOB—of When Radio Was (7 days a week from 5:00AM through 6:00AM ET and also from 10:00PM through 11:00PM ET), is one of the two Maine affiliates (WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm (Saturdays from 9:00AM through 12:00PM ET), is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated Country Music countdown programming (Sunday afternoons from 2:00PM through 6:00PM ET), and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show. WSYY-FM/WSYY-AM are unusual in that while these stations are authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, the stations both have sign-offs every day (WSYY-AM signing off at sun-down, broadcasting only on Weekends (but not between Monday-through-Friday) and WSYY-FM broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week, WSYY-FM's broadcast day concluding with the 11:00PM ET Top-of-the-Hour CBS Radio newscast and then a Nightly Sign-Off Announcement and then an instrumentation of the American national anthem, followed by Dead Air amidst a Transmitter Power-Down, not Signing Back Onto The Air until 4:55AM ET). In Old Town and also Bangor (and continuing southward and/or southwestward), the station has strong FM co-channel interference with Portland-market WHOM (which transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest peak in the Northeast and had for a long time claimed on its website that it has the largest coverage area of any FM station in the United States, its signal spanning five states: NH, ME, VT, MA, NY and also parts of Southern Quebec Province, Canada), this matter being especially problematic before dawn or after dusk.

They have participated in overseas tours, most notably with Finnish band Stratovarius. Their latest album entitled \"Beyond Vengeance\" was released in April 2012 by Massacre Records.\n\n[Biblical genre] A Biblical genre is a classification of Bible literature according to literary genre. The genre of a particular Bible passage is ordinarily identified by analysis of its general writing style, tone, form, structure, literary technique, content, design, and related linguistic factors; texts that exhibit a common set of literary features (very often in keeping with the writing styles of the times in which they were written) are together considered to be belonging to a genre. In Biblical studies, genres are usually associated with whole books of the Bible, because each of its books comprises a complete textual unit; however, a book may be internally composed of a variety of styles, forms, and so forth, and thus bear the characteristics of more than one genre (for example, chapter 1 of the Book of Revelation is prophetic/visionary; chapters 2 and 3 are similar to the epistle genre; etc.).\n\n[NESticle] NESticle is an NES emulator for DOS, created by Icer Addis of Bloodlust Software. Released on April 3, 1997, the widely popular program originally ran under DOS and Windows 95. It was the first freeware NES emulator, and became commonly considered the NES emulator of choice for the 1990s. Initially offering few features and only supporting a handful of games, development proceeded rapidly and to expand usability such that NESticle is today credited with introducing the concept of recordable playthrough for emulation, as well as providing the capacity for users to create their own graphical hacks via an integrated graphics editor. In pioneering this heightened level of access for users, and providing the tools for fans to hack and remix familiar classics, NESticle has been credited by \"Spin\" as representing a milestone toward the development of video game music as a genre.\n\n[Dos (Dos album)] Dos was the debut album recorded by the band Dos. It is a double bass guitar side project for Mike Watt (of the Minutemen and Firehose) and his then-girlfriend (later wife), Kira Roessler (from Black Flag). Formed as a vehicle to take the bass beyond its perceived background role and into the forefront of a band, Dos also became a therapeutic experience in the wake of Roessler's departure from Black Flag and, more tragically, Minutemen D. Boon's sudden death on December 22, 1985. After exchanging demos for the better part of 1986 (Roessler had moved to Connecticut), the duo reconvened to record their self-titled debut late in the year, subsequently releasing it on Watt's own New Alliance Records.\n\n[Three Soldiers] Three Soldiers is a 1921 novel by the American writer and critic John Dos Passos. It is one of the American war novels of the First World War, and remains a classic of the realist war novel genre. H.L. Mencken, then practising primarily as an American literary critic, praised the book in the pages of \"The Smart Set\". \"Until \"Three Soldiers\" is forgotten and fancy achieves its inevitable victory over fact, no war story can be written in the United States without challenging comparison with it—and no story that is less meticulously true will stand up to it. At one blast it disposed of oceans of romance and blather. It changed the whole tone of American opinion about the war; it even changed the recollections of actual veterans of the war. They saw, no doubt, substantially what Dos Passos saw, but it took his bold realism to disentangle their recollections from the prevailing buncombe and sentimentality.\"\n\n[Bachata (music)] Bachata is a genre of Latin American music that originated in the Dominican Republic in the first half of the 20th century with European, Indigenous and African musical elements.\n\n[Chapter Dos] Chapter Dos is the third album from Bachata group, Xtreme.

The fountain was dedicated in May 1916.\n\n[Pulitzer Prize for Music] The Pulitzer Prize for Music is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It was first awarded in 1943. Joseph Pulitzer did not call for such a prize in his will, but had arranged for a music scholarship to be awarded each year. This was eventually converted into a full-fledged prize: \"For a distinguished musical composition of significant dimension by an American that has had its first performance in the United States during the year.\" Because of the requirement that the composition had its world premiere during the year of its award, the winning work had rarely been recorded and sometimes had received only one performance. In 2004 the terms were modified to read: \"For a distinguished musical composition by an American that has had its first performance or recording in the United States during the year.\"\n\n[C. Louis Leipoldt] Leipoldt was born in Worcester in the Cape Province, the son of a preacher, Christian Friedrich Leipoldt, of the NG Kerk in Clanwilliam and grandson of the Rhenish missionary, Johann Gottlieb Leipoldt, who founded Wupperthal in the Cederberg. His mother was Anna Meta Christiana Esselen, daughter of Louis Franz Esselen (1817–1893), another Rhenish missionary at Worcester. His early education was largely at home and for a while, during the Second Boer War, he was a reporter. Between 1902 and 1907, with funding from the botanist Harry Bolus, he read medicine at Guy's Hospital in London and travelled in Europe, America and the East Indies. At times his health was poor. For a period of some six months during 1908, he was the personal physician of the American newspaper magnate, Joseph Pulitzer, aboard Pulitzer's yacht.\n\n[1917 Pulitzer Prize] Pulitzer Prizes were first presented in 1917. There were initially four categories; others that had been specified in Joseph Pulitzer's request were phased in over the next few years. The winners were selected by the trustees of Columbia University. The first Pulitzer Prize winner, French Ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand, who had written the best book about American history, won $2,000. Herbert Bayard Swope won a $1,000 prize for reporting.\n\n[Joseph Pulitzer] Joseph J. Pulitzer ( ; ] ; born József Pulitzer; April 10, 1847 – October 29, 1911) was a newspaper publisher of the \"St. Louis Post Dispatch\" and the \"New York World\". Pulitzer introduced the techniques of yellow journalism (a type of journalism that presents little or no legitimate well-researched news) to the newspapers he acquired in the 1880s. He became a leading national figure in the Democratic Party and was elected congressman from New York. He crusaded against big business and corruption, and helped keep the Statue of Liberty in New York.\n\nQuestion: Who was born first, Frank I. Cobb or Joseph Pulitzer?",

It consisted of a stock body and transmission from the Ford Escort, refitted with an electric propulsion system, every component of which was engineered and manufactured specifically for the car. It incorporated features such as regenerative braking and a multistep charging algorithm, that are common on modern electric vehicles but were quite innovative at the time. The intent was to produce a practical alternative-fueled vehicle with performance comparable to gasoline-powered cars, but like many electric vehicles of that era, the EVcort proved far too expensive to be commercially viable. Nevertheless, the it was used extensively by a variety of institutions for electric vehicle demonstration and testing programs.\n\n[Coda Automotive] CODA Automotive Inc. is a privately held American company headquartered in Los Angeles, California, that designs, semi manufactures lithium-iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery systems built for automotive and power storage utility applications.

NEDRA achieves this by organizing and sanctioning safe, silent and exciting electric vehicle drag racing events.\n\n[Hybrid electric vehicle] A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is a type of hybrid vehicle and electric vehicle that combines a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) system with an electric propulsion system (hybrid vehicle drivetrain). The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle or better performance. There is a variety of HEV types, and the degree to which each functions as an electric vehicle (EV) also varies. The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car, although hybrid electric trucks (pickups and tractors) and buses also exist.\n\nQuestion: What are the two categories of the non-electric version of the neighbourhood electric vehicle?",

These duties varied greatly and, as an example, included mass feeding of civilians, camp sanitation, provision of medical supplies, containment of epidemic diseases, labor relations and rodent control. The Theatre Planning & Research Division developed plans for military government at a national level such as control of Japan's economic institutions, control of Japan's education system and methods for increasing the overall supply of food throughout, not only Japan, but also previously occupied areas like East China. CASA provided comprehensive training and planning in civil affairs administration to officers coming from six schools of military government established at various universities throughout the United States. Army & Navy personnel trained by CASA numbered in the thousands, with more than 1,000 officers assigned to a wide variety of civil affairs positions for the initial occupation of Japan alone.

The major twist this season was that of Team X, a team of contestants that had previously been eliminated. The formation of Team X started with a fake elimination of two players in a challenge in episode one. Two more players were fake eliminated in episode one when both tribe leaders were told that they had to choose one member of their tribe to eliminate. In episode 3, Peder was fake eliminated in a duel against Kristoffer. Following the duel Kristoffer swapped tribes. The final two members of Team X joined when in episode 4 Team X competed in a challenge against North team and South team. North team finished last in the challenge and as a result was eliminated, however, Team X was told that they could save one member of the North team from elimination. Team X chose to save Iris, which meant that she then became part of Team X. Severin also became part of Team X as his the North team decided to give him immunity before the challenge. From episode 5 until the merge, South team and Team X competed in challenges against each other. Following the merge, Peder was ejected from the game for faking an injury. As the game progressed, the original South team members began to pick off what was left of Team X until only South team members remained in the game.

It includes two species, the red-striped oil beetle, \"Berberomeloe majalis\", and the less flamboyant \"Berberomeloe insignis\". Until recently these species were included in the genus \"Meloe\", which is treated in the tribe Meloini; the placement of what was previously called \"Meloe majalis\" instead in a genus within the tribe Lyttini was proposed by Bologna (1988) and has commanded general acceptance. As Bologna notes, it had long been known that the larval development of the red-stripted oil beetle was very different from that of most species placed in \"Meloe\", so that some authors treated it within the Lyttini genus \"Trichomeloe\". However the species does not fit into any other genus of Lyttini, having a unique combination of autapomorphic characters, namely reduced elytra, no wings and modified antennae, so Bologna proposed the new genus. Bologna envisaged that other species currently placed in \"Meloe\" might be found to be anomalous once their larval development was studied in full. However, the addition of a second species to \"Berbermeloe\" came by a different route: García-Paris (1998). revived the name \"insignis\", which had been thought to be merely a synonym for \"majalis\", to describe a rare, distinct population endemic to the Spanish provinces of Granada, Almería and Murcia. Individuals of this type differed from typical \"B. majalis\" in several anatomical characteristics, and hence García-Paris argued that they should be given species status and should also be placed in \"Berberomeloe\". The genus 'Berberomeloe\" is endemic to the Western Mediterranean, specifically the Iberian peninsula, France, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia.\n\n[Dayuma] Dayuma (also Dayumae) (born ca. 1930, - March 1, 2014) was a member of the Huaorani tribe and a citizen of Ecuador.

        "body_text": "Context:\n[Boeing XB-15] The Boeing XB-15 (Boeing 294) was a United States bomber aircraft designed in 1934 as a test for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) to see if it would be possible to build a heavy bomber with a 5000 mi range. For a year beginning in mid-1935 it was designated the XBLR-1. When it first flew in 1937, it was the most massive and voluminous aircraft ever built in the US. It set a number of load-to-altitude records for land-based aircraft, including carrying a 31205 lb payload to 8200 ft on 30 July 1939.\n\n[Eighth Air Force] The Eighth Air Force (8 AF) is a numbered air force (NAF) of the United States Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). It is headquartered at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. The command serves as Air Forces Strategic – Global Strike, one of the air components of United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). The Eighth Air Force includes the heart of America's heavy bomber force: the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, the B-1 Lancer supersonic bomber, and the B-52 Stratofortress heavy bomber aircraft.\n\n[Liberal Army Air Field] Liberal Army Airfield was a World War II Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber training base of the United States Army Air Forces' Second Air Force. It is currently the city-owned Liberal Mid-America Regional Airport.\n\n[Next-Generation Bomber] The Next-Generation Bomber (NGB; unofficially called 2018 Bomber) was a program to develop a new medium bomber for the United States Air Force. The NGB was initially projected to enter service around 2018 as a stealthy, subsonic, medium-range, medium payload bomber to supplement and possibly—to a limited degree—replace the U.S. Air Force's aging bomber fleet (B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer). The NGB program was superseded by the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) heavy bomber program.\n\n[Texas Raiders] Texas Raiders is an American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, a Douglas-Long Beach built B-17G-95-DL. The Commemorative Air Force’s Gulf Coast Wing \"Texas Raiders\" group maintains and flies the aircraft. She is hangared at General Aviation Services, which is located at Conroe North Houston Regional Airport in Conroe, Texas.\n\n[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress] The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engine heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers, the Boeing entry (prototype Model 299/XB-17) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps' performance specifications. Although Boeing lost the contract (to the Douglas B-18 Bolo) because the prototype crashed, the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation. From its introduction in 1938, the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances, becoming the third-most produced bomber of all time, behind the B-24 and the multirole Ju 88.\n\n[Northrop YB-35] The Northrop XB-35 and YB-35 were experimental heavy bomber aircraft developed by the Northrop Corporation for the United States Army Air Forces during and shortly after World War II. The airplane used the radical and potentially very efficient flying wing design, in which the tail section and fuselage are eliminated and all payload is carried in a thick wing. Only prototype and pre-production aircraft were built, although interest remained strong enough to warrant further development of the design as a jet bomber, under the designation YB-49.\n\n[Mitsubishi Ki-1] The Mitsubishi Ki-1, also known as Mitsubishi Army Type 93 Heavy Bomber, was a bomber built by Mitsubishi for the Imperial Japanese Army in the 1930s, which flew for the first time in 1933. Despite its antiquated appearance, the Ki-1 was used in Manchukuo and in north China during the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, in areas where danger from enemy fighter aircraft was minimal.\n\n[Heinkel He 277] The Heinkel He 277 was a four-engine, long-range heavy bomber design, originating as a derivative of the He 177, intended for production and use by the German Luftwaffe during World War II. The main difference was in engine configuration. Rather than using two fire-prone Daimler-Benz DB 606 \"power system\" engines, each of which consisted of side-by-side paired Daimler-Benz DB 601s and with each DB 606 \"power system\" weighing 1.5 tonnes apiece — or two of the similar DB 610, each of which used a pair of DB 605 engines in a similar \"twinned\" configuration on later He 177A airframes (the A-3 model and onwards), the He 277 was meant from the outset to use four BMW 801E 14-cylinder radial engines, each mounted in an individual nacelle and each turning a three-blade, four-meter diameter propeller. The design was never produced, and not a single prototype airframe was ever completed, owing both to the deteriorating condition of the German aviation industry late in the war, and the competition from other long-range bomber designs from other firms, competing for Germany's increasingly scarce aviation production capacity. Although not specifically intended for it at first, partially due to the time-frame in the spring of 1942 in which its ultimate niche was requested for by the RLM, the He 277 design essentially became Heinkel's entry in the important trans-oceanic range \"Amerika Bomber\" competition, struggling to compete against both several other designs from rival firms in the competition for a truly trans-oceanic ranged bomber for the Luftwaffe, and Germany's own rapidly degrading ability, from Allied bombing damage to its aviation plants, to produce military aircraft of any sort.\n\n[Witteman-Lewis XNBL-1] The Wittemann-Lewis NBL-1 \"Barling Bomber\" was an experimental long-range, heavy bomber built for the United States Army Air Service in the early 1920s. Although unsuccessful as a bomber, it was an early attempt at creating a strategic bomber.\n\nQuestion: What type of plane is the four engine heavy bomber, first introduced in 1938 for the United States Army, which is hangared at Conroe North Houston Regional Airport?",

Development of Northeast El Paso, which had begun before the Second World War around the Logan area, started in earnest during the 1950s, when many homes were demolished in the process of the construction of Interstate 10. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas of town due to a high concentration of enlisted military families. Northeast El Paso has historically not developed at a rate comparable to East El Paso and Northwest El Paso, but in recent years, it has seen an increase in development. It is expected that the population in Northeast El Paso will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase for Fort Bliss in the coming years. Northeast El Paso has gained recognition throughout the city for schools like Parkland, Irvin, Andress and Chapin because of their outstanding athletic programs.\n\n[East El Paso] East El Paso is an area of El Paso, Texas, United States, that is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. East El Paso is the fastest growing area of town.

He is the lead vocalist for the Moldovan alternative rock band Gândul Mâței.\n\n[Rock music] Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the African-American genres of blues and rhythm and blues, and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass and drums and one or more singers. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.\n\n[Alternative rock] Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a style of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s. In this instance, the word \"alternative\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, DIY ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \"alternative\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).\n\n[List of rock genres] This is a list of rock music genres consisting of subgenres of popular music that have roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, and which developed into a distinct identity as rock music in the 1960s, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. By the late 1960s, a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene. New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques. Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history.\n\n[Pinoy rock] Pinoy rock, or Filipino rock, is the brand of rock music produced in the Philippines or by Filipinos. It has become as diverse as the rock music genre itself, and bands adopting this style are now further classified under more specific genres or combinations of genres like alternative rock, post-grunge, ethnic, new wave, pop rock, punk rock, funk, reggae, heavy metal, ska, and recently, indie. Because these genres are generally considered to fall under the broad rock music category, Pinoy rock may be more specifically defined as rock music with Filipino cultural sensibilities. It is very easy to identify a Pinoy rock song because the lyrics are often in Filipino, Tagalog, or any other language native to the Philippines.\n\n[Baglamas] The baglamas (Greek: μπαγλαμάς ) (plural \"baglamades\") or baglamadaki (μπαγλαμαδάκι ), a long necked bowl-lute, is a plucked string instrument used in Greek music; it is a version of the bouzouki pitched an octave higher (nominally D-A-D), with unison pairs on the four highest strings and an octave pair on the lower D. Musically, the baglamas is most often found supporting the bouzouki in the Piraeus city style of rebetiko.\n\n[J-rock] Japanese rock (Japanese: 日本のロック , Hepburn: Nihon no Rokku ) , sometimes abbreviated to , is rock music from Japan. Influenced by American and British rock of the 1960s, the first rock bands in Japan performed what is called Group Sounds, with lyrics almost exclusively in English. Folk rock band Happy End in the early 1970s are credited as the first to sing rock music in the Japanese language. Punk rock band the Blue Hearts and heavy metal group X Japan, led Japanese rock bands in the late 1980s and early 1990s by achieving major mainstream success. Japanese rock music has become a cult worldwide, being widely known in Asia and has survived through decades competing with its contemporary derivative local style J-pop.\n\n[D-A-D] D-A-D is a Danish rock band.

        "body_text": "Context:\n[John Hoskins (officer)] Vice Admiral John Madison Hoskins (October 22, 1898 – March 30, 1964) was an officer and aviator in the United States Navy. Four years after graduating the United States Naval Academy, Hoskins entered flight school and served his entire career in naval aviation, eventually commanding aircraft carriers in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. Despite losing his right foot in an explosion aboard USS \"Princeton\" (CVL-23) in 1944, Hoskins refused retirement and went on to serve as the first commanding officer of the new USS \"Princeton\" (CV-37). After the war, Hoskins became a leading proponent of jet aircraft on carriers, was assigned to training command of the first naval aviators designated for carrier assignment, and himself flew as commanding officer of the flight demonstration which convinced the Department of the Navy that jet aircraft should be a part of the aircraft carrier's fixed-wing complement.\n\n[Gloster Meteor] The Gloster Meteor was the first British jet fighter and the Allies' only jet aircraft to achieve combat operations during the Second World War. The Meteor's development was heavily reliant on its ground-breaking turbojet engines, pioneered by Sir Frank Whittle and his company, Power Jets Ltd. Development of the aircraft began in 1940, although work on the engines had been under way since 1936. The Meteor first flew in 1943 and commenced operations on 27 July 1944 with No. 616 Squadron RAF. The Meteor was not a sophisticated aircraft in its aerodynamics, but proved to be a successful combat fighter. Gloster's 1946 civil Meteor F.4 demonstrator \"G-AIDC\" was the first civilian-registered jet aircraft in the world.\n\n[List of surviving Gloster Meteors] The Gloster Meteor is a twin-engined jet fighter, the first jet aircraft to serve with the RAF and the only Allied jet aircraft to reach combat in World War II. Almost 4,000 were produced, mostly in service with the RAF between 1944 and 1965. Meteors also served with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), whose aircraft saw action in the Korean War; other users included the Argentinian, Brazilian, Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Ecuadorian, French and Israeli air forces. Many are preserved but only five are airworthy.\n\n[Aviator call sign] An aviator call sign or aviator callsign is a call sign given to a military pilot, flight officer, and even some enlisted aviators. The call sign is a specialized form of nickname that is used as a substitute for the aviator's given name. It is used on flight suit and flight jacket name tags, painted/displayed beneath the officer's or enlisted aircrewman's name on aircraft fuselages or canopy rails, and in radio conversations. They are most commonly used in tactical jet aircraft communities (i.e., fighter and attack) than in other aircraft communities (i.e., airlift, mobility, maritime patrol), but their use is not totally exclusive to the former. Many NASA Astronauts with military aviator backgrounds are referred to during spaceflights by their call signs rather than their first names.\n\n[Samoan Clipper] Samoan Clipper was one of ten Pan American Airways Sikorsky S-42 flying boats. It exploded near Pago Pago, American Samoa, on January 11, 1938, while piloted by famous aviator Ed Musick. Musick and his crew of six died in the crash. The aircraft was carrying only airmail and express freight; no passengers were aboard.\n\n[Richard Bong] Richard Ira Bong (September 24, 1920 – August 6, 1945) was a United States Army Air Forces major and Medal of Honor recipient in World War II. He was one of the most decorated American fighter pilots and the country's highest-scoring flying ace in the war, being credited with shooting down 40 Japanese aircraft. All of his aerial victories were in the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter. He died in California while testing a jet aircraft shortly before the Japanese surrendered and the war ended.\n\n[Zip fuel] Zip fuel, also known as high energy fuel (HEF), is any member of a family of jet fuels containing additives in the form of hydro-boron compounds, or \"boranes\". Zip fuels offered higher energy density than conventional fuels, helping extend the range of jet aircraft, a major problem for the military planners in the 1950s. A number of aircraft were designed to make use of zip, including the XB-70 Valkyrie, XF-108 Rapier, as well as the BOMARC, and even the nuclear-powered aircraft program. In testing, the fuels proved to have several serious problems and the entire effort was eventually canceled in 1959. It was later claimed that the Blackstar spaceplane uses zip fuel, but Blackstar is almost certainly mythical.\n\n[Air New Zealand fleet] The Air New Zealand mainline fleet consists of Boeing jet aircraft for long-haul flights, and Airbus jet aircraft for domestic- and short-haul international flights. Its two wholly owned subsidies, Mount Cook Airline and Air Nelson, operate ATR 72 and Bombardier Q300 turboprop aircraft respectively.\n\n[Mark Serrurier] Mark Serrurier (12 May 1904 in Pasadena, California – 14 February 1988) is the son of Dutch-born electrical engineer, Iwan Serrurier, who created the Moviola in 1924 which became the technology used for film editing. Mark was a graduate of Caltech and went on to work on designs for the Mt. Palomar 200 inch (5 m) Hale telescope. The pioneering truss design he invented for that instrument's massive tube structure (the \"Serrurier truss\") is still used today in large telescope designs. During World War II, Mark worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory testing jet aircraft engines. In 1942, Rolf Sabersky worked in mechanical design on the Southern California Cooperative Wind Tunnel under Serrurier and Hap Richards.\n\n[R.I. Bong Air Force Base] Richard I.

Together, they produce over 40,000 lbs. of organically-grown vegetables each year. The Grange also operates New York City’s largest apiary, with over thirty naturally-managed honey beehives, which yields approximately 1,500 pounds of honey annually. It was started in the spring of 2010 by transplanted Wisconsinite Ben Flanner, now President and Head Farmer, with the help of Anastasia Plakias, current Vice President, and Gwen Schantz, current Chief Operating Officer. The group took out loans, contributed their own money and found community investors to fund the project. The Brooklyn Navy Yard farm was financed in part by at $592,730 grant from the NYCDEP's Green Infrastructure Grant Program. In addition to growing and distributing local vegetables and herbs, Brooklyn Grange provides urban farming and green roof consulting and installation services to clients worldwide and partner with numerous non-profit organizations throughout New York to promote healthy and strong local communities.\n\n[Rich LeFevre] Rich LeFevre (nickname \"The Locust\") is a competitive eater from Henderson, Nevada.

Many of them are the direct descendants of streetcar lines (see list of streetcar lines in Brooklyn); the ones that started out as bus routes were almost all operated by the Brooklyn Bus Corporation, a subsidiary of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, until the New York City Board of Transportation took over on June 5, 1940. Of the 55 local Brooklyn routes operated by the New York City Transit Authority, roughly 35 are the direct descendants of one or more streetcar lines, and most of the others were introduced in full or in part as new bus routes by the 1930s. Only the eastern section of the B82 (then the B50), the B83, and the B84 were created by New York City Transit from scratch, in 1978, 1966, and 2013, respectively.\n\n[Sports in New York (state)] New York has two Major League Baseball teams, the New York Yankees (based in the Bronx) and the New York Mets (based in Queens). New York is home to three National Hockey League franchises: the New York Rangers in Manhattan, the New York Islanders in Brooklyn and the Buffalo Sabres in Buffalo. New York has two National Basketball Association teams, the New York Knicks in Manhattan, and the Brooklyn Nets in Brooklyn. New York has one Major League Soccer team: New York City FC. Although the New York Red Bulls represent the New York metropolitan area they play in Red Bull Arena, located in Harrison, New Jersey.\n\n[Queens] Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New York City. It is geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the southwestern end of Long Island, and to Nassau County farther east on Long Island; in addition, Queens shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. Coterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (after Brooklyn), with a census-estimated 2,333,054 residents in 2016, approximately 48% of them foreign-born. Queens County also is the second-most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, behind the neighboring borough of Brooklyn, which is coterminous with Kings County. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States. If each of New York City's boroughs were an independent city, Queens also would be the nation's fourth most populous, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.\n\n[Brooklyn Heights] Brooklyn Heights is an affluent residential neighborhood within the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Originally referred to as Brooklyn Village, it has been a prominent area of Brooklyn since 1834. The neighborhood is noted for its low-rise architecture and its many brownstone rowhouses, most of them built prior to the Civil War. It also has an abundance of notable churches and other religious institutions. Brooklyn's first art gallery, the Brooklyn Arts Gallery, was opened in Brooklyn Heights in 1958. In 1965, a large part of Brooklyn Heights was protected from unchecked development by the creation of the Brooklyn Heights Historic District, the first such district in New York City. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.\n\n[Fort Greene, Brooklyn] Fort Greene is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.

The work was printed on different colours and sizes of paper - and contained in a plastic bag. It was sold at the Edinburgh Festival of 1973, where Hampson was working with the Liverpool-based multimedia group Zoom Cortex. (See Adrian Henri, \"Events and Happenings\", Thames and Hudson, for Zoom Cortex.)The second issue maintained the same format (a collection of loose pages in a plastic bag) but with an increased number of poets. Richard Kostelanetz's assemblages have been described by the editors as their model for this mode of publication. With the third issue, the magazine adopted the standard little-magazine format of the time: A4 pages, card cover, stapled. Alembic 3, 4 and 5 also marked a more self-conscious engagement with contemporary London-based experimental poetry. \"Alembic\" 3 (Spring 1975) announced the intention to engage with \"one area of contemporary creative practice' in each issue in order to represent the range of poetry being written in the UK. This issue focused on contemporary work that had its roots in surrealism. It included Lee Harwood's essay 'Surrealist Poetry Today', which had been a talk given at the Poetry Society, and it included work by Harwood, Paul Matthews, Jeff Nuttall, Heathcote Williams and others. \"Alembic\" 4 was edited solely by Hampson and was dedicated to open field poetry and the idea of place.

This issue was also the first to be offset. (Like \"Alembic\" 4. it had a wrap around cover rather than card.) \"Alembic\" 6 (Summer 1977)was again solely edited by Hampson. It included further work by contributors to earlier issues. The featured poet was the Australian poet David Miller: as well as poems and essays by Miller, there was also poetry by Robert Lax and a reprint of work by Charles Madge, on both of whom Miller had written. In addition, there was also work by Rosmarie Waldrop, Tom Leonard, Elaine Randell and Barry MacSweeney. \"Alembic\" 7 (Spring 1978), edited by Edwards and Hampson out of Lower Green Farm, was the 'Assemblage Issue', assembled by inviting a range of poets and visual artists to provide the contents. It included work by Jeremy Adler, Paul Buck, Herbert Burke, Paula Claire, cris cheek, Bob Cobbing, Glenda George, Robert Sheppard, E. E. Vonna-Michel, Lawrence Upton and others. A particular feature of this issue was that every cover was different: they were hand-printed by Vonna-Michel with a rubber-stamp used for the title. \"Alembic\" 9 (to be edited by Hampson) was promised, but never appeared: Edwards had begun to publish \"Reality Studios\" as a slimmer, faster and more frequent publication. This eventually metamorphosed (through an amalgamation with Wendy Mulford's Street Editions) into Reality Street, which has been a major publisher of experimental poetry and prose since the 1980s.\n\n[Nancy Barry] Nancy M.

They are found in areas with warm moist summers and mild winters. The three major areas of this forest type occur in the Northern Hemisphere: eastern North America, East Asia, and Europe. Smaller areas occur in Australasia and southern South America. Examples of typical trees in the Northern Hemisphere's deciduous forests include oak, maple, beech, and elm, while in the Southern Hemisphere, trees of the genus \"Nothofagus\" dominate this type of forest. The diversity of tree species is higher in regions where the winter is milder, and also in mountainous regions that provide an array of soil types and microclimates. The largest intact, temperate deciduous forest in the world is protected inside of the six-million-acre Adirondack Park in Upstate New York.\n\n[Arenga] Arenga is a genus of palms, native to Southeast Asia, southern China, New Guinea, and northern Australia. They are small to medium-sized palms, growing to 2–20 m tall, with pinnate leaves 2–12 m long. Arenga palms can grow in areas with little sunlight and relatively infertile soil.\n\n[Chestnut] The chestnut group is a genus (Castanea) of eight or nine species of deciduous trees and shrubs in the beech family Fagaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n[June] June is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the second month to have the length of 30 days. June contains the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the day with the most daylight hours, and the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, the day with the fewest daylight hours (excluding polar regions in both cases). June in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to December in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. In the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the traditional astronomical summer is 21 June (meteorological summer begins on 1 June). In the Southern hemisphere, meteorological winter begins on 1 June.\n\n[March] March is the third month of the year in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars. It is the second month to have a length of 31 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, the meteorological beginning of spring occurs on the first day of March. The March equinox on the 20th or 21st marks the astronomical beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, where September is the seasonal equivalent of the Northern Hemisphere's March.\n\n[American chestnut] The American chestnut (\"Castanea dentata\") is a large, monoecious deciduous tree of the beech family native to eastern North America. Before the species was devastated by the chestnut blight, a fungal disease, it was one of the most important forest trees throughout its range, and was considered the finest chestnut tree in the world. It is estimated that between 3 and 4 billion American chestnut trees were destroyed in the first half of the 20th century by blight after its initial discovery in 1904. Very few mature specimens of the tree exist within its historical range, although many small shoots of the former live trees remain. There are hundreds of large (2 to 5 ft diameter) American chestnuts outside its historical range, some in areas where less virulent strains of the pathogen are more common, such as the 600 to 800 large trees in northern Lower Michigan.\n\n[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves] The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves included severe heat waves that impacted most of the United States, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, Hong Kong, North Africa and the European continent as a whole, along with parts of Canada, Russia, Indochina, South Korea and Japan during May, June, July, and August 2010. The first phase of the global heatwaves was caused by a moderate El Niño event, which lasted from June 2009 to May 2010. The first phase lasted only from April 2010 to June 2010, and caused only moderate above average temperatures in the areas affected. But it also set new record high temperatures for most of the area affected, in the Northern Hemisphere. The second phase (the main, and most devastating phase) was caused by a very strong La Niña event, which lasted from June 2010 to June 2011. According to meteorologists, the 2010–11 La Niña event was one of the strongest La Niña events ever observed. That same La Niña event also had devastating effects in the Eastern states of Australia. The second phase lasted from June 2010 to October 2010, caused severe heat waves, and multiple record-breaking temperatures. The heatwaves began on April 2010, when strong anticyclones began to develop, over most of the affected regions, in the Northern Hemisphere. The heatwaves ended in October 2010, when the powerful anticyclones over most of the affected areas dissipated.\n\n[Dryocosmus kuriphilus] Dryocosmus kuriphilus is a species of gall wasp known by the common names chestnut gall wasp, Oriental chestnut gall wasp, and Asian chestnut gall wasp. It is native to China and it is known in many other parts of the world, particularly the Northern Hemisphere, as an introduced species and an invasive horticultural pest. It attacks many species of chestnut (genus \"Castanea\"), including most cultivated varieties. It is considered the world's worst pest of chestnuts.\n\n[Subtropical ridge] The subtropical ridge, also known as the subtropical high or horse latitudes, is a significant belt of atmospheric high pressure situated around the latitudes of 30°N in the Northern Hemisphere and 30°S in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the product of the global air circulation cell known as the Hadley Cell. The subtropical ridge is characterized by mostly calm winds, which act to reduce air quality under its axis by causing fog overnight, and haze during daylight hours as a result of the stable atmosphere found near its location. The air descending from the upper troposphere flows out from its center at surface level toward the upper and lower latitudes of each hemisphere, creating both the trade winds and the westerlies. The subtropical ridge moves poleward during the summer, reaching its most northern latitude in early fall, before moving equatorward during the cold season. The El Niño southern climate oscillation (ENSO) can displace the northern hemisphere subtropical ridge, with La Niñas allowing for a more northerly axis for the ridge, while El Niños show flatter, more southerly ridges. The change of the ridge position during ENSO cycles changes the tracks of tropical cyclones that form around their equatorward and western peripheries. As the subtropical ridge varies in position and strength, it can enhance or depress monsoon regimes around their low-latitude periphery. The term \"horse latitudes\" refers to and is synonymous with the subtropical ridge or subtropical high.\n\n[Buys Ballot's law] In meteorology, Buys Ballot's law (] ) may be expressed as follows: In the Northern Hemisphere, if a person stands with his back to the wind, the atmospheric pressure is low to the left, high to the right. This is because wind travels counterclockwise around low pressure zones in the Northern Hemisphere. It is approximately true in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the angle between the pressure gradient force and wind is not a right angle in low latitudes.\n\nQuestion: Do Chestnut and Arenga trees both grow in the northern hemisphere?",

One of the appendices lists all 168 people killed in the blast, along with brief biographical information. (There were plans to include a chapter about his execution in the softcover edition.) It is the only biography authorized by McVeigh himself, and was based on 75 hours of interviews that the authors had with McVeigh. McVeigh was said to be pleased overall with the book, but disappointed with the way he was portrayed and the explanation of his motive.

Of the 900,000 trees produced annually in British Columbia, most are cut from native pine stands.\n\n[Mount Ingino Christmas Tree] The Mount Ingino Christmas Tree is a lighting illumination in the shape of a Christmas tree that is installed annually on the slopes of Mount Ingino (Monte Ingino in Italian) outside the city of Gubbio, in Umbria region in Italy. The tree is also called the Gubbio Christmas Tree or \"the biggest Christmas tree in the world\". In 1991 the Guinness Book of Records named it \"The World's Largest Christmas Tree\".\n\n[Foster Hutchinson (jurist)] Foster Hutchinson Jr. (d. 1815) was a member of the Nova Scotia Council and one of the Puisne judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. He was the only son of Foster Hutchinson (judge), Sr., the nephew of Governor of Massuchsetts Thomas Hutchinson and grandchild of Governor of Nova Scotia Paul Mascarene. He arrived in Halifax from Boston with his father as Loyalists (1776). Hutchinson became a lawyer and worked under Chief Justice Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange. Sir George Prévost appointed him an Assistant Justice to the Supreme Court (1809). He is buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia).\n\n[Chicago Christmas Tree] The first official Christmas tree in the city of Chicago was installed in 1913 in Grant Park and lit on Christmas Eve by then-mayor Carter Harrison. This first tree was a 35 ft tall spruce tree. In December 1956 the official tree, though still installed in Grant Park (at Michigan Avenue and Congress Parkway), was not an individual tree. The tree was a combination of many smaller trees, stood 70 ft tall, and was decorated with over 4000 lights and 2000 ornaments. Beginning with Christmas 1966 the official Chicago Christmas tree was placed in Civic Center Plaza, now known as Daley Plaza. With the exception of 1981, the tree has been installed in Daley Plaza ever since.\n\n[Ainslie Glen, Nova Scotia] Ainslie Glen (Scottish Gaelic: \"Gleann nam Màgan\" ) is a small community in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located in Inverness County on Cape Breton Island. In 2016, a tree on Crown Lands was chosen to become the Boston Christmas Tree.\n\n[French Village, Nova Scotia] French Village is a rural community of the Halifax Regional Municipality in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on Chebucto Peninsula. French village initially included present day villages of Tantallon, Glen Haven and French Village. The French that migrated to the area were French speaking families from the Principality of Montbeliard (annexed by France 1793)and known as the \"Foreign Protestants\". They had come to Nova Scotia between 1750 and 1752 to settle Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Contrary to belief, they were not Huguenots. In 1901, the Halifax and Southwestern Railway was built through the area and the railway choose the name French Village for the station serving the three communities. The French Village station, actually located in Tantallon, has been preserved as a cafe beside the recreational trail that follows the old Halifax & Southwestern Railway roadbed.\n\nQuestion: Why does the City of Boston get their christmas tree from Ainslee Glen Nova Scotia?",

In 1997, Raven made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision and was subsequently acquired by them. After the acquisition, many of the studio's original developers, largely responsible for creating the \"Heretic\" and \"\" games, left to form Human Head Studios.\n\n[The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon] The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon is the third and final installment in \"The Legend of Spyro\" trilogy, as well as the tenth anniversary game of the series. It was developed by Étranges Libellules and published by Activision in North America and Sierra Entertainment in International for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360. Tantalus Media developed the Nintendo DS version. It is the end of the second Spyro continuity, with \"\" serving as the second reboot of the franchise after Vivendi Games merged with video game publisher Activision to form the Activision Blizzard holding company on July 9, 2008.\n\n[Guitar Hero 5] Guitar Hero 5 (initially referred to as Guitar Hero V) is a music rhythm game and the fifth main entry in the \"Guitar Hero\" series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, \"Guitar Hero World Tour\", \"Guitar Hero 5\" is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. \"Guitar Hero 5\" adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n\n[Right Back at It Again] \"Right Back at It Again\" is the second track and the first single from A Day to Remember's fifth album, \"Common Courtesy\" (2013). In October 20, 2015, the song was featured in Activision rhythm-music game, \"\".\n\n[Yameen] Yameen is a hiphop producer from Philadelphia, PA. His most recent work, \"Come On & Go Off\" was released on September 2nd, 2014 on Rumble Pack Records. His music can be heard weekly on the Activision videogames podcast, One of Swords where he is also occasionally a guest commentator.\n\n[Intellivision Rocks] Intellivision Rocks is the PC-only sequel to the original PC version of \"Intellivision Lives!\". As with \"Intellivision Lives!\", \"Intellivision Rocks\" is a collection of games which were originally found on the Intellivision, presented in emulated form. It mainly features 3rd-party games from Activision and Imagic. In addition, several unreleased games are included.\n\n[Form 8-K] Form 8-K is a very broad form used to notify investors in United States public companies of specified events that may be important to shareholders or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. This is one of the most common types of forms filed with the SEC. After a significant event like bankruptcy or departure of a CEO, a public company generally must file a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days to provide an update to previously filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and/or Annual Reports on Form 10-K. Form 8-K is required to be filed by public companies with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For a list of events that would trigger a Form 8-K to be filed, see the Official SEC Form 8-K Summary, briefly below, and this fully annotated Form 8-K, which contains links to all rules and SEC guidance applicable to the form.\n\n[Guitar Hero] The Guitar Hero series (sometimes referred to as the Hero series) is a series of music rhythm games first published in 2005 by RedOctane and Harmonix, and distributed by Activision, in which players use a guitar-shaped game controller to simulate playing lead, bass guitar, and rhythm guitar across numerous rock music songs. Players match notes that scroll on-screen to colored fret buttons on the controller, strumming the controller in time to the music in order to score points, and keep the virtual audience excited. The games attempt to mimic many features of playing a real guitar, including the use of fast-fingering hammer-ons and pull-offs and the use of the whammy bar to alter the pitch of notes. Most games support single player modes, typically a Career mode to play through all the songs in the game, and both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. With the introduction of \"Guitar Hero World Tour\" in 2008, the game includes support for a four-player band including vocals and drums. The series initially used mostly cover versions of songs created by WaveGroup Sound, but most recent titles feature soundtracks that are fully master recordings, and in some cases, special re-recordings, of the songs. Later titles in the series feature support for downloadable content in the form of new songs.\n\n[Lotion play] Lotion Play is a subset of the better known Wet-And-Messy fetish (WAM), which typically involves participants using food (such as pudding or whipped cream), mud, or paint as a lubricant to facilitate sexual activity. Lotion Play isolates lotion specifically as a lubricating medium - setting it apart in the Wet-and-Messy genre, as other common WAM mediums do not have such specific popularity as Lotion Play. Lotion Play (ローションプレイ , rōshon purei ) , also known as gookkake, gluekkake, is a popular fetish, form of Japanese erotica and prostitution request involving the use of copious amounts of lubricant, which in the Japanese language is referred to by the Old-French word \"lotion\" (ローション in Japanese).Typically lotion play involves a participant rubbing lotion on another using their body, sexual intercourse in a pool or bath filled with lotion, or lotion being poured over the participants during sex. In Japan (and other parts of the world), lotion is available in concentrated form (e.g.: liter/gallon) which can be added to hot water to produce the desired amount of lotion. A 1-gallon concentrate will typically yield 6-10 gallons of lotion (J-Lube Lotion Concentrate). The main component in most lotion is polyacrylate. A similar effect can be achieved by dissolving powdered methyl cellulose in water.\n\nQuestion: What form of play does Yameen and Activision have in common?",

At the time of the 2011 census, there were 12,167 people living in the town with another 861 nearby. It is the administrative center of Ghanzi District and is known as the \"Capital of the Kalahari\". Ghanzi District measures 117910 km2 and is bordered by Ngamiland to the north, Central District to the east, and Kgalagadi and Kweneg Districts to the south. Its western border is shared with Namibia.\n\n[Desert riparian] Desert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year. It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year. The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration. The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow. Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas. Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (\"Populus fremontii\"), Arizona ash (\"Fraxinus velutina\"), arroyo willow (\"Salix lasiolepis\"), Goodding's willow (\"Salix gooddingii\"), red willow (\"Salix laevigata\"), California fan palm (\"Washingtonia filifera\"), and invasive species such as salt cedar (\"Tamarix ramosissima\"), giant reed (\"Arundo donax\"), and Russian olive (\"Elaeagnus angustifolia\"). Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows. Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees.\n\n[Central District (Botswana)] Central is the largest of Botswana's districts in terms of area and population. It encompasses the traditional homeland of the Bamangwato people. Some of the most politically connected Batswana have come from the Central District, including former President Sir Seretse Khama, former President Festus Mogae, and current President Lt. General Seretse Ian Khama. The district borders Zimbabwe's Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South Provinces, and in the southeast Central borders South Africa's Limpopo Province, North-East in the northeast, Kgatleng in the south, Kweneng in southwest, Ghanzi in the North and North-West in the northwest direction\n\n[Ghanzi District] Ghanzi (sometimes Gantsi) is a district in western Botswana, bordering Namibia in the west and extending east into much of the interior of the country. The district's administrative centre is the town of Ghanzi. Most of the eastern half of Ghanzi makes up the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. The human population at the 2001 census was 43,370, less populous than that of any other district in Botswana. Ghanzi's area is 117,910 km².\n\n[Kang, Botswana] Kang is a village in Kgalagadi District of Botswana. It is situated in the Kalahari Desert and lies on the Trans-Kalahari Highway between Ghanzi in the north and Sekoma in the south. Kang also provides access to the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in the south-west and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in the north-east. The route via Ghanzi takes one to the Namibian border, whilst that to Sekoma leads to Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. The population was 5,985 according to the 2011 census.\n\n[Dasht-e Kavir] Dasht-e Kavir (Persian: دشت كوير‎ ‎ , 'Low Plains' in classical Persian, from \"khwar\" (low), and \"dasht\" (plain), flatland), also known as Kavir-e Namak ( 'salty lowlands') and the Great Salt Desert, is a large desert lying in the middle of the Iranian plateau. It is about 800 km by 320 km with a total surface area of about 77600 sqkm , making it the Earth's 26th largest desert. The area of this desert stretches from the Alborz mountain range in the north-west to the Dasht-e Lut in the south-east and is partitioned between the Iranian provinces of Khorasan, Semnan, Tehran, Isfahan and Yazd\n\n[Ncojane] Ncojane or Nojane is a town in the Kalahari desert of Ghanzi District, western Botswana. It is located 20 kilometres from the border with Namibia, and it has both primary and secondary schools and a clinic. The population was 1,439 in 2001 census.\n\n[Pobiti Kamani] Pobiti Kamani (Bulgarian: Побити камъни , \"planted stones\"), also known as The Stone Desert, is a desert-like rock phenomenon located on the north west Varna Province border in Bulgaria. It is considered the only desert in Bulgaria and one of few found in Europe. The desert consists of sand dunes and several groups of natural rock formations on a total area of 13 km². The formations are mainly stone columns between 5 and 7 meters high and from 0.3 to 3 meters thick. The columns do not have solid foundations, but are instead hollow and filled with sand, and look as if they were stuck into the surrounding sand, which gives the phenomenon its name. Sandstorms and sand twisters have also been known to commonly occur in this desert region of Bulgaria. The Stone Desert is not only a well known European tourist attraction due to its desert like habitat, but it is one of few places where desert type vegetation such as cactus are known to grow. It is also the only desert in Europe in which desert reptilians and other desert type animalia are found to thrive. The Stone Desert along with the Tabernas Desert of Spain is one of two naturally formed deserts in all of Europe and the only known naturally formed desert in Eastern Europe.\n\n[Ordos Desert] The Ordos Desert, also known as the Muu-us (bad water) Desert, () is a desert and steppe region lying on a plateau in the south of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China (centered ca. ). The soil of the Ordos is a mixture of clay and sand and, as a result, is poorly suited for agriculture. It extends over an area of approximately 90,650 km². It comprises two large deserts: the 7th largest desert in China, the Kubuqi Desert (库布其沙漠 /庫布齊沙漠; \"pinyin\": KùbùqíShāmò ) in the north, and the 8th largest desert in China, the Muu-us Desert (毛乌素沙漠 /毛烏素沙漠; \"pinyin\": MáowūsùShāmò ), in the south.\n\n[Kalahari Desert] The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for 900000 km2 , covering much of Botswana, parts of Namibia and regions of South Africa.\n\nQuestion: What is the area of the desert that Ghanzi is in the middle of?",

It is located 5 kilometers from Issele-Uku, the headquarters of Aniocha North and has a growing land area of 16sq km and current estimated population of about 10,000 inhabitants. It is bordered to the west by Onicha-Ugbo, to the North by Idumuje-Ugboko and Ewohinmi in Edo State, to the East by Onicha-Uku and to the south by Issele-Uku. The name Idumuje in the Esan language could be translated to mean; Idumu - Community/Quarters and Oje - King/Royal. In other words, Idumuje means Royal Quarters or Kings' Quarter. Worthy to note: Another Idumuje named location could be found at present in Benin (in proximity to the Royal Palace of the Oba of Benin). The suffix \"Unor\" (meaning - home) is an inclusion to the town's name so as to differentiate it from the breakaway community Idumuje -Ugboko; by a man called Nwoko and his supporters some 300 years ago. Ugboko is translated to mean \"Ugbo\" - Farm & \"Oko\" - a shortening of the name Nwoko.\n\n[Daviesia] Daviesia, commonly known as Bitter-peas, is a large genus of flowering plants in the legume family. They are native to Australia, with a center of diversity in western Australia. The genus is named in honour of Hugh Davies, a Welsh botanist. They have nitrogen-fixing bacteria contained in root nodules like other genera in their family.\n\n[Beech] Beech (\"Fagus\") is a genus of deciduous trees in the family Fagaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia and North America. Recent classification systems of the genus recognize ten to thirteen species in two distinct subgenera, \"Engleriana\" and \"Fagus\". The \"Engleriana\" subgenus is found only in East Asia, and is notably distinct from the \"Fagus\" subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. Further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves, the visible tertiary leaf veins, and a long, smooth cupule-peduncle. \"Fagus japonica\", \"Fagus engleriana\", and the species \"F. okamotoi\", proposed by the botanist Chung-Fu Shen in 1992, comprise this subgenus. The better known \"Fagus\" subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. This group includes \"Fagus sylvatica\", \"Fagus grandifolia\", \"Fagus crenata\", \"Fagus lucida\", \"Fagus longipetiolata\", and \"Fagus hayatae\". The classification of the European beech, \"Fagus sylvatica\" is complex, with a variety of different names proposed for different species and subspecies within this region (for example \"Fagus taurica\", \"Fagus orientalis\", and \"Fagus moesica\"). Research suggests that beeches in Eurasia differentiated fairly late in evolutionary history, during the Miocene. The populations in this area represent a range of often overlapping morphotypes, though genetic analysis does not clearly support separate species.\n\n[Arabized Berber] Arabized Berber denotes an inhabitant of the Maghreb region in northwestern Africa, whose native language is a local dialect of Arabic and whose origins are mainly Berber.\n\n[Walloon church] A Walloon church (French: \"Église Wallonne\"; Dutch: \"Waalse kerk\") describes any Calvinist church in the Netherlands and its former colonies whose members originally came from the Southern Netherlands and France and whose native language is French. Members of these churches belong to the Walloon Reformed Church (French: \"Réformé wallon\"; Dutch: \"Waals Hervormd\" or, prior to 1815, \"Waals Gereformeerd\"), a denomination of the long-distinguished Dutch-speaking Dutch Reformed Church.\n\n[Gmelina leichhardtii] Gmelina leichhardtii, commonly known as the white beech is a rainforest tree of eastern Australia. Scattered individuals or small groups of trees naturally occur from the Illawarra district of New South Wales (34½° S) to near Proserpine in tropical Queensland. The white beech or grey teak is a fast-growing tree, growing on volcanic and alluvial soils in areas of moderate to high rainfall. It also grows on poorer sedimentary soils in fire free areas. White beech may occasionally be seen in Australian rainforests, their status is considered \"uncommon\". Unlike the Australian red cedar, the white beech has not recovered particularly well after logging in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n[English Language Proficiency Test] The English Language Proficiency Test (ELPT) was the name of a SAT II last administered in January 2005. It was a one-hour multiple choice test given on English language proficiency by The College Board. A student whose native language was not English could have chosen to take this test instead of or in addition to Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) for college entrance depending upon requirements of the schools in which the student was planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT II's were known as Achievement Tests. The ELPT assessed both the understanding of spoken and written standard American English and the ability to function in a classroom where English is spoken. The test was intended for students whose best language was not English; who attend U.S. high schools, or who had studied in an international school where courses were taught in English; had completed two to four years of English language instruction in an English as a Second Language program or in English enrichment courses; and/or students who spoke a language other than English at home or work. It was scored on a scale of 901 to 999\n\n[Pinus strobiformis] Pinus strobiformis, commonly known as Southwestern white pine, Mexican white pine or Chihuahua white pine, is a medium-sized white pine tree whose native habitat is in southwestern United States and Mexico. It is typically a high-elevation pine growing mixed with other conifers (a Montane forest).\n\n[Wildlife of Kerala] Most of Kerala, whose native habitat consists of wet evergreen rainforests at lower elevations and highland deciduous and semi-evergreen forests in the east, is subject to a humid tropical climate. however, significant variations in terrain and elevation have resulted in a land whose biodiversity registers as among the world’s most significant.\n\n[Polar bear] The polar bear (\"Ursus maritimus\") is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (\"Ursus arctos middendorffi\"). A boar (adult male) weighs around 350 – , while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means \"maritime bear\" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.\n\nQuestion: Whose native growing land is more south, Beech or Daviesia?",

The events leading up to the fatal clash included killings of three white settlers by Aboriginal people, and the killing of one Aboriginal person and the death by poisoning of five others by white settlers. The limited archival records indicate that three Aboriginal people were killed or died of wounds from the clash, and five were captured, however, accounts of the killing of up to 260 Aboriginal people at the cliffs have persistently circulated since at least 1880.\n\n[Battle of Hightower] The Battle of Hightower (also called Battle of Etowah) in 1793 was part of the Cherokee–American wars, in which the Cherokee sought to defend their territory from illegal immigration by white settlers. This particular battle took place at the Cherokee village of Etowah Town (\"Itawayi\"), overlooking Downtown Rome, GA in the modern Floyd County, Georgia, resulting in the defeat of the Cherokee by a force led by John Sevier, future Governor of Tennessee.\n\n[Cherokee Heritage Center] The Cherokee Heritage Center is a non-profit historical society and museum campus that seeks to preserve the historical and cultural artifacts, language, and traditional crafts of the Cherokee. The Heritage center also hosts the central genealogy database and genealogy research center for the Cherokee People. The Heritage Center is located on the site of the mid-19th century Cherokee Seminary building in Park Hill, Oklahoma, a suburb of Tahlequah, and was constructed near the old structure. It is a unit of the Cherokee National Historical Society and is sponsored by the Cherokee Nation, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, and other area tribes. The center was originally known as Tsa-La-Gi but is now known as the Cherokee Heritage Center.\n\n[Ani-kutani] The Ani-kutani (ᎠᏂᎫᏔᏂ) were the ancient priesthood of the Cherokee people. According to Cherokee legend, the Ani-Kutani were slain during a mass uprising by the Cherokee people approximately 300 years prior to European contact. This uprising was sparked by the fact that the Ani-Kutani had become corrupt and conducted sexual improprieties. The ancient structure of Cherokee Society and the Cherokee Clans were closely linked to the beliefs of the Ani-Kutani.\n\n[Hooker Jim] Hooker Jim (1851–1879) was a Modoc warrior who played a pivotal role in the Modoc War. Hooker Jim was the son-in-law of tribal medicine man Curley Headed Doctor. After white settlers massacred Modoc women and children contemporaneously with the Battle of Lost River, Hooker Jim led a group of Modocs overland to Captain Jack's Stronghold. During their march, Hooker Jim and his warriors killed several white settlers in revenge.\n\n[Boyds Creek, Tennessee] Boyds Creek is an unincorporated community in Sevier County, Tennessee, United States. It is named for a small southward-flowing tributary of the French Broad River of the same name, which itself derives its name from a Virginian trader, killed by a band of Cherokee Indians, whose body was thrown into the stream. The creek was the site of a 1780 battle (The Battle of Boyd's Creek) between white settlers and Cherokee angry at the settlers' encroachment onto their hunting territory.\n\n[Old Tassel] Old Tassel (or sometimes Corntassel) (Cherokee language: \"Utsi'dsata\"), ( died 1788), was \"First Beloved Man\" (the equivalent of a regional Cherokee chief) of the Overhill Cherokee after 1783. He continuously tried to keep the Cherokee people of the Overhill region out of the Cherokee–American wars being fought at the time between the American frontiersmen and the Chickamauga warriors under Dragging Canoe. He was murdered under a flag of truce while defending his tribe from white settlers.\n\n[Cockstock Incident] The Cockstock Incident was a major factor in the passage of an 1844 exclusion law against free black men living within the U.S. Territory of Oregon. It centered on a fight between a Wasco Native American man, Cockstock, and a free black man, James D. Saules, over ownership of a horse. The argument escalated into a melee that killed three men, and led to rhetoric among white settlers that African-Americans could create an uprising among local Native American tribes against black and white settlers alike.\n\n[Squandro] Squandro was sachem of the Sokokis tribe in 1675, an American Indian tribe that lived near the Saco River at Saco in Maine. Squandro gained respect among whites because his tribe lived in peace with white settlers for about 50 years. Legend dictates that Squandro returned a white girl who had been captured in a previous raid and reared by his tribe. Dignified and solemn, Squandro was believed to have powers of sorcery and magic. Due to white settlers killing his son and perhaps his wife, Squandro uttered the \"Saco Curse\" and carried out the first blow in King Philip's War.\n\n[Cherokee–American wars] The Cherokee–American wars, also known as the Chickamauga Wars, were a series of back-and-forth raids, campaigns, ambushes, minor skirmishes, and several full-scale frontier battles in the Old Southwest from 1776 to 1795 between the Cherokee (\"Ani-Yunwiya\" or \"Nana Waiya\", \"Tsalagi\") and the Americans on the frontier. Most of the events took place in the Upper South. While their fight stretched across the entire period, there were times, sometimes ranging over several months, of little or no action.\n\nQuestion: What was the other name for the war between the Cherokee people and white settlers in 1793?",

Although Macfarlane did not formally name the plant, he noted that \"[a]ll available morphological details suggest that this is a hybrid between \"N. villosa\" and \"N. rajah\"\". It was finally described in 1976 by Shigeo Kurata as \"N. × kinabaluensis\".

Robin Gibb also had his own successful solo career.\n\n[I Was a Lover, a Leader of Men] \"I Was a Lover, a Leader of Men\" is a single released in November 1965, recorded by the Bee Gees, written by Barry Gibb. The song was backed with \"And the Children Laughing\". However, it was released in the Philippines in January 1966. It is also the first track of the Bee Gees' first album, The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs. This song won Barry a song-writing award.\n\n[You Wouldn't Know (Bee Gees song)] \"You Wouldn't Know\" is a song written by Barry Gibb which was recorded by the Bee Gees and released as the B-side of their version of \"Every Day I Have to Cry\" and later included on the album \"The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs\" (1965). The album of the same name was released in Europe by Tring Records and features the Bee Gees songs from 1963-1966.\n\n[Tomorrow Tomorrow (Bee Gees song)] \"Tomorrow Tomorrow\" is a song by the Bee Gees written by Barry and Maurice Gibb. The song was originally intended to be recorded by Joe Cocker. It was the first Bee Gees single released after Robin Gibb had quit the group which was now down to a trio featuring Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb, and drummer Colin Petersen.\n\n[The Kid's No Good] The Kid's No Good was to have been Barry Gibb's debut solo album following his departure from the Bee Gees in December 1969. There was no official title given to the album at the time. The line \"the kid's no good\", which the album is commonly titled on several bootleg releases, is also featured in the Bee Gees song \"Come Home Johnny Bridie\" on the 1973 album \"Life in a Tin Can\". The album features orchestral arrangements by Bill Shepherd who performed the same role for the Bee Gees from 1965 to 1972 (Robin and Maurice Gibb's solo recordings were done with different arrangers).\n\n[I Want Home] \"I Want Home\" is a song by the English rock band Bee Gees, written by Barry Gibb and released as a single in Australia in early 1966, backed with \"Cherry Red\". Their last single on Leedon had not been a hit, so the credit \"Barry Gibb and the Bee Gees\" used on the last several discs now reverted to simply \"Bee Gees\". Neither song appeared on any Bee Gees album until the 1967 compilation album, \"Turn Around, Look At Us\", but both were featured on \"Brilliant From Birth\" the 1998 anthology of the group's Australian recordings.\n\n[I Laugh in Your Face] \"I Laugh in Your Face\" is a ballad performed by the Bee Gees, written by Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb and released in March 1969 on the album \"Odessa\". Most of the vocal solos are performed by Barry Gibb except for a little part in the middle of the song sung by Robin Gibb.\n\n[The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs] The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs is the debut studio album by the English pop band the Bee Gees. (1967's \"Bee Gees' 1st\" was the \"international\" debut album). Released under the artist title \"Barry Gibb & the Bee Gee's\" \"[sic]\", it was released in November 1965 on the Australian Leedon label. It is a compilation of most of the Gibb brothers' singles that had been released over the previous three years in Australia, which accounts for the many different styles of music on it.\n\n[Timber! (Bee Gees song)] \"Timber!\" is a song recorded by the Bee Gees, written by Barry Gibb. The song was released in Australia as their second single in July 1963, backed with \"Take Hold of That Star\". It was later included on the group's first album \"The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs\".\n\n[Cucumber Castle] Cucumber Castle is the seventh studio album by the Bee Gees, released in April 1970. It was produced by Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb, and Robert Stigwood. It consists of songs from their television special of the same name, which was named after a song on their 1967 album \"Bee Gees' 1st\". \"Cucumber Castle\" was the only Bee Gees album not to feature any recorded contributions from Robin Gibb, as he had left the group before the album was recorded.

In 1922, Allen partnered with Frank Wright. They combined their initials to create the brand \"A&W\" and inspired a restaurant chain, founded in 1922. Originally, A&W root beer drinks sold for five cents.\n\n[Charles Elmer Hires] Charles Elmer Hires (August 19, 1851 – July 31, 1937) was an early promoter of commercially prepared root beer. He was a Quaker pharmacist from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who formulated the eponymous Hires Root Beer beverage.\n\n[B&amp;K Rootbeer] B-K Root Beer is an independent chain of drive-in fast-food restaurants, distinguished by their draft root beer and root beer floats. A midwestern chain, B-K restaurants are located in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. B-K stands for \"Bergerson & Kenefick\".\n\n[Hires Root Beer] Hires Root Beer is a soft drink which is marketed by Dr Pepper Snapple Group. Introduced in 1876, it is considered the second longest continuously made soft drink in the United States. Only Vernors Ginger Ale , dating to 1866, is older.\n\n[Lucozade] Lucozade is a soft drink marketed as a range of sports and energy drinks. Created in 1927 as \"Glucozade\" by a Newcastle pharmacist, William Owen, as an energy source for the sick, it was renamed Lucozade in 1929 and acquired by Beecham's in 1938.\n\n[A&amp;W Restaurants] A&W Restaurants, Inc. is a chain of fast-food restaurants distinguished by its draft root beer and root beer floats. Its origins date back to when Roy W. Allen opened a walk-up root beer stand in Lodi, California, in 1919. Allen's employee Frank Wright partnered with him and founded the first A&W restaurant in Sacramento, California, in 1923. The company name was taken respectively from the initials of their last names—Allen and Wright. The company became famous in the United States for its \"frosty mugs,\" where the mugs would be kept in the freezer and eventually get filled with A&W Root Beer before they are served to customers.\n\n[Mug Root Beer] MUG Root Beer, A PepsiCo Subsidiary/Root Beer Corporation is a brand name of root beer made by the New Century Beverage Company of San Francisco, California, a subsidiary of PepsiCo.\n\n[A&amp;W Cream Soda] A&W Cream Soda is a cream soda carbonated soft drink introduced by A&W Root Beer in 1986. A&W Root Beer was first sold at a Veterans Day parade in Lodi, California in 1919 and the company established in 1922 by Frank Wright and Roy Allen. The first product they created was A & W Root Beer. It was not until 1986 that A&W Brands, headquartered in White Plains, N.Y. introduced A&W Cream Soda and A&W Diet Cream Soda through its network of franchised bottlers and distributors. Although cream soda had been created in 1852 by E.M. Sheldon, A&W Brands was one of the first American companies to make it commercially. In 1993, A&W Brands was purchased by Cadbury/Schweppes, and in 1995 Cadbury/Schweppes purchased the Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up Company, which made A&W a part of the Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. In 2001, DPSU purchased the Snapple Beverage Group (formally TriArc Beverages), and moved the New York-based company operations to its new headquarters in Plano, Texas. This acquisition put A&W within the same company as the top soda brand companies and made A&W Cream Soda the top brand in cream sodas.\n\n[Virgil's Root Beer] Virgil's Root Beer is a microbrewed gourmet root beer, developed by Edward Crowley and Jill Fraser Crowley, who was the company's president (and founded and serves as CEO of fashion brand Jill Milan). Virgil's Root Beer won the \"Outstanding Beverage\" Award at the International Fancy Food and Confection Show in 1994, 1996 and 1997. The quality of and demand for Virgil’s Root Beer prompted Whole Foods' request for a cola by the brand: “Whole Foods said, 'Give me a cola with Virgil’s, and you’re in.'”\n\n[Root beer] Root beer is a sweet North American soft drink traditionally made using the sassafras tree \"Sassafras albidum\" (sassafras) or the vine \"Smilax ornata\" (sarsaparilla) as the primary flavor. Root beer may be alcoholic or non-alcoholic, come naturally free of caffeine or have caffeine added, and carbonated or non-carbonated. It usually has a thick, foamy head when poured. Modern, commercially produced root beer is generally sweet, foamy, carbonated, nonalcoholic, and flavoured using artificial sassafras flavouring. Sassafras root is still used to flavor traditional root beer, but since sassafras was banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration due to the controversially claimed carcinogenicity of its constituent safrole, most commercial recipes do not contain sassafras. Some commercial root beers do use a safrole-free sassafras extract.\n\nQuestion: Does Lucozade pre-date Hires Root Beer? ",

Like many other early Germanic names, it is dithematic, consisting of two meaningful constituents put together. In this case, those constituents are \"ger\" (meaning 'spear') and \"/la:k /\" (meaning 'motion'). The meaning of the name is thus 'spear thrower'.\n\n[Louis M. Pate Jr.] Louis Milford Pate Jr. (born September 22, 1936) is a Republican member and Deputy President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina General Assembly. He represented the state's eleventh House district from 1995 through 1996 and from 2003 through 2008. His district included constituents in Wayne county. Pate is now the State Senator representing the 7th district (including constituents in Lenoir, Pitt, and Wayne counties).\n\n[Montana's at-large congressional district] Montana is represented in the US House of Representatives by one at-large congressional district, among the 435 in the U.S. Congress. The district is the largest U.S. congressional district by population, with just over 1 million constituents. It is also the second-largest by land area, after Alaska's at-large congressional district.\n\n[Constituent (linguistics)] In syntactic analysis, a constituent is a word or a group of words that function(s) as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with phrase structure grammars, although dependency grammars also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using \"constituency tests\". These tests manipulate some portion of a sentence and based on the result, clues are delivered about the immediate constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are phrases. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a head lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below.\n\n[FooDB] FooDB (The Food Database) is a freely available, open-access database containing chemical (micronutrient and macronutrient) composition data on common, unprocessed foods. It also contains extensive data on flavour and aroma constituents, food additives as well as positive and negative health effects associated with food constituents. The database contains information on more than 28,000 chemicals found in more than 1000 raw or unprocessed food products. The data in FooDB was collected from many sources including textbooks, scientific journals, on-line food composition or nutrient databases, flavour and aroma databases and various on-line metabolomic databases. This literature-derived information has been combined with experimentally derived data measured on thousands of compounds from more than 40 very common food products through the Alberta Food Metabolome Project which is led by Dr. David Wishart of the University of Alberta. Users are able to browse through the FooDB data by food source, name, descriptors or function. Chemical structures and molecular weights for compounds in FooDB may be searched via a specialized chemical structure search utility. Users are able to view the content of FooDB using two different “Viewing” options: FoodView, which lists foods by their chemical compounds, or ChemView, which lists chemicals by their food sources. Knowledge about the precise chemical composition of foods can be used to guide public health policies, assist food companies with improved food labelling, help dieticians prepare better dietary plans, support nutraceutical companies with their submissions of health claims and guide consumer choices with regard to food purchases.\n\n[Chemical waste] Chemical waste is a waste that is made from harmful chemicals (mostly produced by large factories). Chemical waste may fall under regulations such as COSHH in the United Kingdom, or the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), as well as state and local regulations also regulate chemical use and disposal. Chemical waste may or may not be classed as hazardous waste. A chemical hazardous waste is a solid, liquid, or gaseous material that displays either a “Hazardous Characteristic” or is specifically “listed” by name as a hazardous waste. There are four characteristics chemical wastes may have to be considered as hazardous. These are Ignitability, Corrosivity, Reactivity, and Toxicity. This type of hazardous waste must be categorized as to its identity, constituents, and hazards so that it may be safely handled and managed. Chemical waste is a broad term and encompasses many types of materials. Consult the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), Product Data Sheet or Label for a list of constituents. These sources should state whether this chemical waste is a waste that needs special disposal.\n\n[None of the Above Party of Ontario] The None of the Above Party of Ontario (NOTA; French: \"Aucune de ces Réponses Parti de l’Ontario\" ) is a minor political party in the province of Ontario, Canada named after the expression \"none of the above\". It was founded in 2014 by Greg Vezina in response to his disillusionment with the current major political parties. The party aims to \"elect independent MPPs who are not bound by party control and who truly can represent their constituents first.\" It supports the use of referenda, term limits and Recall elections.\n\n[Gerard] Gerard ( or ; Old French: ] ) is a male forename of Proto-Germanic origin, variations of which exist in many Germanic and Romance languages. Like many other early Germanic names, it is dithematic, consisting of two meaningful constituents put together. In this case, those constituents are \"gari\" > \"ger-\" (meaning 'spear') and -\"hard\" (meaning 'hard/strong/brave').\n\n[Greg Gianforte] Gregory Richard Gianforte (born April 17, 1961) is an American businessman, engineer, and politician who is the U.S. Representative for Montana's at-large congressional district.

The major habitat is estuaries of Kolyma, Indigirka, Yana and Lena. In terms of functionality, Yakutian Laikas might serve as a reindeer herder’s dog (olenegonka), hunter’s dog, and a sled dog.\n\n[Planet Laika] Planet Laika (プラネットライカ ) is a role-playing video game developed by Quintet and Zeque for the PlayStation home game console. The game follows the main character, Laika, through a mission to Mars which forces the player to manipulate Laika's multiple-personality disorder in order to solve puzzles. All the characters in the game have dog heads, a possible reference to the Soviet space dog Laika. The game was only released in Japan.\n\n[Russo-European Laika] Russo-European Laika (Russko-Evropeĭskaya Láĭka) is the name of a breed of hunting dog that originated in the forested region of northern Europe and Russia, one of several breeds developed from landrace Laika dogs of very ancient Spitz type. The \"Russo-European Laika\" itself dates to a breeding program begun in 1944 by E. I. Shereshevsky of the All-Union Research Institute for the Hunting Industry, in Kalinin (now Tver) Province.\n\n[West Siberian Laika] The West Siberian Laika or \"WSL\", is a breed of hunting dog and a breed of spitz type. Russian publications indicate that the term West Siberian Laika loosely applied to hunting dogs originating with the Mansi and Khanty people in Ural and West Siberia, but there were no standards or registrations of WSL as such until 1930. Then WWll disrupted it for a while, but \"systematic breeding with registrations\" resumed after the war ended, in 1946. This was the time the breed began taking modern shape. Before that hunters only knew of Mansi Laika and Khanty Laika. In early 1960 many hunters in Ural still preferred the term Mansi Laika, when speaking of West Siberian Laika. In Russian language, the term Laika originated from the word \"layat\" that means to bark. The word Laika simply means \"barker\". Any hunting Laika is a bark pointer (pointing at animal of interest by barking and staying with the animal ). It is a versatile dog depending on use and environment, but in certain parts of the country they have become more specialized.\n\n[Andalusian Hound] The Andalusian hound (Spanish: \"Podenco andaluz\" ) is a dog breed originating in Spain, especially Andalusia. These dogs are similar to other Iberian breeds such as the Ibizan Hound, the Portuguese Podengo, the Podenco Canario and the Maneto. In the Iberian Peninsula there are cave paintings representing dogs with a strong resemblance to these races. Dogs very similar to these, including the Cirneco dell'Etna and Pharaoh Hound, have been bred in much of the Mediterranean basin since ancient times. Despite the widespread belief that the podencos were introduced into Spain some 3,000 years ago by the Phoenicians, recent genetic studies have concluded that these dogs actually have a close genetic relationship with other European hunting dogs and are no more \"primitive\" than the others.\n\n[East Siberian Laika] The East Siberian Laika (Vostotchno-Sibirskaia Laika) is a Russian breed of dog of spitz type, a hunting dog originating in parts of Siberia east of the Yenisei River.\n\n[Laika] Laika (Russian: Лайка ; c. 1954 – November 3, 1957) was a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space, and the first animal to orbit the Earth. Laika, a stray dog from the streets of Moscow, was selected to be the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2 that was launched into outer space on November 3, 1957.\n\n[Bo (dog)] Bo (born October 9, 2008) is a pet dog of the Obama family, the former First Family of the United States. Bo is a male Portuguese Water Dog. President Barack Obama and his family were given the dog as a gift after months of speculation about the breed and identity of their future pet. The final choice was made in part because Malia Obama's allergies dictated a need for a hypoallergenic breed. Bo has occasionally been called \"First Dog\". In August 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female dog of the same breed.\n\n[Breed standard (dogs)] A breed standard (also called bench standard or the standard) in the dog fancy is a set of guidelines covering specific \"externally observable\" qualities such as \"appearance\", \"movement\", and \"temperament\" for that dog breed. Breed standards are not scientific documents, but are written for each breed by clubs of hobbyists called breed clubs for their own specific requirements. Details and definitions within breed standards for a specific dog breed may vary from breed club to breed club and from country to country. Dog breed standards are similar in form and function to breed standards for other domesticated animals.\n\n[Portuguese Podengo] The Portuguese Podengo is an ancient multi-sensory hound (sight and scent) breed of dog from Portugal. As a breed, the Podengo is divided into three size categories that are not interbred: small (Pequeno), medium (Medio) and large (Grande). Their coats are either short and 'smooth', or longer and 'wired'. The smooth coated variety is traditional, dating back to the 5th century, whereas the wire coated variety is an outcome of the assimilation of various other breeds during the 20th century. In general, the breed is healthy; the Pequeno (small) variety has an average lifespan of approximately 15–17 years.\n\nQuestion: Are Portuguese Podengo and Russo-European Laika the same breed of dog?",

He served as Spanish administrator of the Public Treasury in Guam until the United States captured the island during the Spanish–American War. When Martínez was named Commissioner, Sisto quickly staged a coup d'état and claimed the position as the highest ranking Spanish official on the island. He began arming native guards and commandeering ammunition, but was briefly overthrown by Venancio Roberto and other pro-American elements on December 31, 1898, but was officially put into power by officers of the United States Navy only two days later after they decided he held a legitimate claim to the position.

After giving up his post, he was found to have misappropriated public funds, arrested, and exiled to Manila.\n\n[William Short (American ambassador)] William Short (1759–1849) was Thomas Jefferson's private secretary when Jefferson was a peace commissioner and then the United States Minister to France in Paris, from 1784 to 1789. Jefferson, later the third President of the United States, was a lifelong mentor and friend. In a 1789 letter, Jefferson referred to Short as his \"adoptive son.\" Short was an early member and president (1778–1781) of Phi Beta Kappa at the College of William & Mary, was elected to Virginia's Executive Council in 1783–1784, served as America's chargé d'affaires in France during the French Revolution from 1789–1792, was then appointed as America's Minister to the Netherlands and as a treaty commissioner to Spain. (The United States did not have ambassadors until 1893. Until that time, the highest ranking diplomats were known as ministers.) Although his diplomatic career was not as celebrated or long as Short may have wished, and his love affair with a French noblewoman ended with her marrying another man, Short was a successful businessman and an opponent of slavery who died very wealthy in America.\n\n[John F. Weston] John F. Weston (November 13, 1845 – August 3, 1917) was a Union Army officer in the American Civil War and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during a raid on Confederate shipping.

Having been assistant commissary general of subsistence and commissary general of subsistence from 1897 to 1905, including commissary general for the American forces in Cuba during the Spanish–American War, Weston finished his career as the highest ranking U.S. Army officer in the Philippines and, in the last year of his service, as commander of the Department of California.\n\n[Valedictorian] Valedictorian is an academic title of success used in the United States, Canada, Central America, and the Philippines for the student who delivers the closing or farewell statement at a graduation ceremony (called a valediction). The chosen valedictorian is often the student with the highest ranking (highest Grade Point Average, or GPA for short) among their graduating class. The term is an Anglicised derivation of the Latin \"vale dicere\" (\"to say farewell\"), historically rooted in the valedictorian's traditional role as the final speaker at the graduation ceremony before the students receive their diplomas. So the valedictory address generally is considered a final farewell to classmates, before they disperse to pursue their individual paths after graduating.\n\nQuestion: What was the highest ranking in the United States for a single written by an English multi-instrumentalist?",

The breed was given its English name by European travelers due to its resemblance to known terrier breeds. The Tibetan name for the breed, Tsang Apso, roughly translates to \"shaggy or bearded (\"apso\") dog, from the province of Tsang\". Some old travelers' accounts refer to the dog as Dokhi Apso or \"outdoor\" Apso, indicating a shaggy or bearded working dog which lives outdoors.\n\n[João Fernandes Lavrador] João Fernandes Lavrador (] ) was a Portuguese explorer of the late 15th century. He was the first modern explorer in the coasts of the Northeast of Northern America, including the Labrador peninsula, which bears his name. The popular dog breed Labrador Retriever is named after the peninsula and thus by effect also bears his name.\n\n[J.F. Englert] J. F. Englert is an American fiction novel writer, non-fiction writer, and screenwriter. He resides in Manhattan, New York. He is married to P. Englert, has a daughter named C. Englert, and a dog called R. Englert. Among his fiction novels include the \"Bull Moose Dog Run Mystery Series\": \"A Dog About Town\", \"A Dog Among Diplomats\", and \"A Dog At Sea\", which protagonize the dog narrator, \"Randolph\", a Labrador retriever.\n\n[Labrador Retriever] The Labrador Retriever, also Labrador, is a type of retriever-gun dog. The Labrador is one of the most popular breeds of dog in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n[Chesapeake Bay Retriever] The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog belonging to the Retriever, Gundog, and Sporting breed groups. Members of the breed may also be referred to as a Chessie, CBR, or Chesapeake. The breed was developed in the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century. Historically used by area market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, it is primarily a family pet and hunting companion. They are often known for their love of water and their ability to hunt. It is a medium to large sized dog similar in appearance to the Labrador Retriever. The Chesapeake have a wavy coat, rather than the Labrador's smooth coat. They are described as having a bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, alertness, intelligence, and love of water as some of their characteristics.\n\n[List of Labrador Retrievers] This list of Labrador Retrievers covers notable individual dogs that belong to this breed. The Labrador retriever is the most popular breed of dog (by registered ownership) in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The breed is exceptionally affable, intelligent, energetic and good natured, making them excellent and popular pets, companions and working dogs. They have a high work ethic Common working roles for Labradors include: hunting, tracking and detection, disabled-assistance, carting, and therapy work. Approximately 60–70% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors.\n\n[Labrador Husky] The Labrador Husky is a spitz type of dog that was bred for work as a very strong, fast sled dog; it is a purebred originating from Canada. Although the breed's name may be baffling, it is \"not\" a mix between a Labrador Retriever and a husky. The breed is very little known, and there are no breed clubs that currently recognize it.\n\n[Labradoodle] A labradoodle ( ), also known as a labrapoodle ( ) is a crossbreed dog created by crossing the Labrador Retriever and the Standard, Miniature or Toy Poodle. The term first appeared in 1955, but was not popularized until 1988, when the mix began to be used as a hypoallergenic guide dog. Currently, they are not considered a breed by any major fancier and breeder organization. Not all labradoodles are hypoallergenic, but it is a quality that many look for and appreciate in this type of crossbreed.\n\n[Retriever] A retriever is a type of gun dog that retrieves game for a hunter. Generally gun dogs are divided into three major classifications: retrievers, flushing spaniels, and pointing breeds. Retrievers were bred primarily to retrieve birds or other prey and return them to the hunter without damage; retrievers are distinguished in that nonslip retrieval is their primary function. As a result, retriever breeds are bred for soft mouths and a great willingness to please, learn, and obey. A soft mouth refers to the willingness of the dog to carry game in its mouth without biting into it. \"Hard mouth\" is a serious fault in a hunting dog and is very difficult to correct. A hard-mouthed dog renders game unpresentable or at worst inedible.\n\n[Shōnen to Inu] Shōnen to Inu (少年と犬 ) is a Japanese manga written by Akira Itō and illustrated by Yoshihiro Takahashi.

His work has appeared in many books in both England and the United States, as well as in \"The New Yorker\" and \"Poetry\". Martory’s personal “charm,” the poet Ann Lauterbach once said, “devolved back to the original meaning of ‘spell.’” However, as Ashbery has noted, “Both the humor and the sadness in his poems are always rendered with an unemphatic clarity that is certainly Mozartian.”\n\n[A. E. Housman] Alfred Edward Housman ( ; 26 March 1859 – 30 April 1936), usually known as A. E. Housman, was an English classical scholar and poet, best known to the general public for his cycle of poems \"A Shropshire Lad\". Lyrical and almost epigrammatic in form, the poems wistfully evoke the dooms and disappointments of youth in the English countryside. Their beauty, simplicity and distinctive imagery appealed strongly to late Victorian and Edwardian taste, and to many early 20th-century English composers both before and after the First World War. Through their song-settings, the poems became closely associated with that era, and with Shropshire itself.\n\n[Darragh Park] Darragh Park (July 24, 1939 – April 17, 2009) was an American Artist, and the literary executor of the estate of Pulitzer Prize–winning poet James Schuyler.

E. Housman, published in \"A Shropshire Lad\" in 1896. It is the thirteenth in a cycle of 63 poems. One of Housman's most familiar poems, it is untitled but often anthologised under a title taken from its first line. \"The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations\" includes fourteen of its sixteen lines. Housman's \"New York Times\" obituary mentioned the poem: \"Typical of his lyrics is the poem which has thrilled the world where English is spoken.\" Its subject matter, \"then and now\" temporal perspective, meter, and narrative structure within each verse parallel those of William Butler Yeats' \"Down by the Salley Gardens\", itself a reworking of \"The Rambling Boys of Pleasure\".\n\nQuestion: Do James Schuyler and A.

The majority of their wealth derives from the heritage of Bud and Sam Walton, who were the co-founders of the world's largest retailer, Walmart. The three most prominent living members (Jim, Rob and Alice) have consistently been in the top ten of the \"Forbes\" 400 since 2001, as were John ( 2005) and Helen (d. 2007) prior to their deaths. Christy Walton took her husband John's place after his death.\n\n[Helen Walton] Helen Robson Kemper Walton (December 3, 1919 – April 19, 2007) was the wife of Wal-Mart and Sam's Club founder Sam Walton. At one point in her life, she was the richest American and the eleventh-richest woman in the world.\n\n[John II of Jerusalem] John II of Jerusalem (1259 or ca. 1267 – 20 May 1285 in Nicosia) was the eldest son of Hugh III de Poitiers, king of Cyprus and Isabella of Ibelin. He succeeded his father as King of Cyprus (as John I) on March 24 and was crowned at Santa Sophia, Nicosia on May 11, 1284. His succession as King of Jerusalem was opposed by Charles I of Naples, who had also disrupted his father's succession. John died the following year on 20 May, having never married and leaving no children. He was buried in the church of St. Demetrius or according to some Santa Sophia, in Nicosia. According to some authors he was poisoned by his brothers, one of whom, Henry II, succeeded him in Cyprus and Jerusalem.

John would however prove to be the last of the Lords of the Isles, overmighty subjects of the Stewart Kings of Scotland and virtual kings in their own right in the Western Isles. His struggle for power with King James III of Scotland ended in humiliation, following which his illegitimate son Angus Óg rebelled against his rule. In a bitter civil war, John's fleet of galleys met those of Angus sometime in the early 1480s off the coast of Mull at the Battle of Bloody Bay, in which John's cause was defeated. After Bloody Bay he became an inconsequential figure; and Angus continued to dominate the affairs of Clan Donald up until his murder in 1490. In 1493 James IV brought the Lordship of the Isles to an end. John died unlamented in 1503, having witnessed the almost complete destruction of his family inheritance.\n\n[John de Vesci] John de Vesci, sometimes spelt Vescy, was a prominent 13th-century noble.

The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915. Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary. As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail. However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself. Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail.\n\n[Mount Jefferson (Nevada)] Mount Jefferson is the highest mountain in both the Toquima Range and Nye County in Nevada, United States.

It was introduced in September 1983 for model year 1984. The Civic's wheelbase was increased by 2–5 inches (13 cm) to 93.7 inches (hatchback) or 96.5 inches (sedan). A three-door hatchback/kammback, four-door sedan (also known as the Honda Ballade), the five-door \"Shuttle\" station wagon, and sporting CRX coupé shared common underpinnings. This included MacPherson strut suspension with torsion bars in the front and a rear beam with coil springs. However, the body panels were largely different between models. The Civic-based Honda Quint five-door hatchback also underwent a model change, and became the Honda Quint Integra, available as both a three- and five-door fastback. The Quint Integra (soon just \"Integra\") was sold at the Japanese \"Honda Verno\" dealership along with the CR-X. The Civic in Japan was now exclusive to \"Honda Primo\", along with Honda's kei cars as well as superminis like the Honda City.\n\n[Honda Inspire] The Honda Inspire is a luxury sedan introduced by Honda in 1990 derived from Honda Accord chassis. The first Inspire debuted in 1990 as the Accord Inspire, a sister nameplate to the Honda Vigor, but sold at different retail channels in Japan, known as \"Honda Verno\" for the Vigor/Saber, and the Inspire at \"Honda Clio\" stores. The Inspire was developed during what was known in Japan as the Japanese asset price bubble or \"bubble economy\".\n\n[Honda Rafaga] The Honda Rafaga series CE4 and CE5 was a compact 4-door sedan sold only in Japan by Honda, introduced in January 1993, and used the same 5-cylinder engine that was used in the Honda Inspire and the Honda Vigor and shared a platform with the second generation CE series Honda Ascot. \"Rafaga\" is Spanish for \"gust\" or \"blustery\". The engine is installed longitudinally, the same configuration used in the Vigor and Inspire. The Rafaga was third in Hondas hierarchy of sedans, and a sister car to the Ascot, which was sold at the \"Honda Primo\" dealership network. The Rafaga was sold in Japan at \"Honda Verno\" dealerships, and was one level up from the Honda Integra. As with other Honda products, the Rafaga used double wishbone suspension at the front and rear wheels. The \"2.5 S\" trim level came with a front suspension upper strut brace in the engine compartment. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used premium grade fuel.\n\n[Honda Torneo] The Honda Torneo is a sedan introduced by Honda in 1997 exclusively for the Japanese domestic market, derived from the Honda Accord.

Early Vigors were more upmarket versions of the Accord and served as Honda's flagship until the arrival of the Honda Legend.

The series against the Lakers also became the birth of the Mavericks Royal Blue-Out games in the AAC, with almost all fans wearing T-shirts that read \"The Time is Now\". In the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks won the last 3 games winning by 4th quarter comebacks, to win their second Western Conference Championship, and a trip to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2006, with a rematch against the Heat.

These were the famous war elephants used by Carthage in the Punic Wars, their conflict with the Roman Republic. Although the subspecies has been formally described, it has not been widely recognized by taxonomists. Other names for this animal include the North African forest elephant, Carthaginian elephant, and Atlas elephant. Originally, its natural range probably extended across North Africa and down to the present Sudanese and Eritrean coasts.\n\n[Agee (film)] Agee is a 1980 American documentary film directed by Ross Spears, about the writer James Agee.

Several Roman writers give accounts of Surus, which was probably a large Asian elephant with one tusk. Although a Carthaginian coin struck in the time of Hannibal depicts an African elephant, historians believe Surus was an Indian elephant descended from those seized by Ptolemies of Egypt, Alexander's successors, in their campaigns in Syria. According to some accounts, the animal was the last of the 37 war elephants Hannibal took with him on his 218 B.C. crossing of the Alps, during the Second Punic War.\n\n[To Shoot an Elephant] To Shoot an Elephant is a 2009 documentary film about the 2008-2009 Gaza War directed by Alberto Arce and Mohammad Rujailahk.\n\n[Hannibal Brooks] Hannibal Brooks is a 1969 British war comedy film directed by Michael Winner and written by Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement based on a story by Winner and Tom Wright.

It was the first album released by Greensleeves Records, and found favour with followers of both reggae and punk rock in the United Kingdom. The album employed several major hits as the basis for the tracks, including Horace Andy's versions of \"Ain't No Sunshine\" (on the title track) and \"A Quiet Place\" (\"Poison Flour\" and \"I Shall Fear No Evil\"), John Holt's \"Ali Baba\" (\"I Killed the Barber\"), and Gregory Isaacs' \"Thief a Man\" (on \"Gimmie Mi Gun\") and \"My Religion\" (\"Unitone Skank\").

Even more so than Springfield's two first US albums, \"Ooooooweeee!!!\" can be considered as a compilation since it comprises tracks both from her British debut album \"A Girl Called Dusty\" as well as recordings originally issued on various A- and B-side singles and EP's - recorded and released in the UK over a period of some eighteen months. \"Ooooooweeee!!!\" also features tracks from Springfield's September 1964 sessions in New York, produced by Shelby Singleton Jr, some of which would remain unreleased in her native Britain until 1998, and the CD re-issue of the 1965 album \"Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty\".\n\n[COM LAG (2plus2isfive)] COM LAG (2plus2isfive) is the sixth compilation EP by the English rock band Radiohead, released in March 2004 in Japan and Australia.

It contains a mixture of tracks from different recording sessions; some tracks were recorded with Jeff Barry for an aborted third album for Atlantic Records, other tracks were recorded for Philips in the UK between April and July 1970 – these came to be Springfield's final recordings with longtime producer and arranger Johnny Franz. Some, such as \"Willie and Laura Mae Jones\", recorded with Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin, had been previously released as singles in the US. \"See All Her Faces\" collects many of those tracks, recorded from 1969 to 1971, placing seven of the British recordings on Side A, while Side B comprises tracks recorded both in the UK and the US. As a result, the album has no cohesive sound, but offers many different styles of music. The album boasts eight producers, including Springfield herself. It has been suggested that \"See All Her Faces\" is best appreciated track by track, rather than as a whole stylistic statement, as her album \"Dusty in Memphis\" is often praised to be.\n\n[Hail to the Thief] Hail to the Thief is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead.

It gathered seven tracks from Springfield's British 1967 album \"Where Am I Going?\" with both the A- and B-sides of the singles \"Give Me Time\"/\"The Look of Love\" and \"What's It Gonna Be\"/\"Small Town Girl\" and became Springfield's final release on the Philips label in the US. In early 1968 she signed with Atlantic Records in America and as a consequence her 1968 album \"Dusty... Definitely\", recorded for Philips in the UK, was never issued in the US at the time and her next LP to be released on the North American market instead became her keynote work \"Dusty in Memphis\". The tracks from the entire \"Dusty...Definitely\" album, the British recordings on the 1972 release \"See All Her Faces\" as well as a series of A- and B-side singles recorded in the UK between the years 1968 and 1972 were all first issued in the US in 1999 on the Rhino/Atlantic Records compilation \"Dusty in London\".\n\nQuestion: The compilation EP \"COM LAG \" by Radiohead collects many B-side singles from their album released in the UK by what record company?",

His more than 40 years of active duty included service in the War of 1812.\n\n[France–Netherlands relations] The French–Dutch relations refer to the interstate and bilateral relations between France and the Netherlands. The two countries notably share a border division in the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, to which the northern part of the island is a French overseas collectivity known as the Collectivity of Saint Martin, while the southern part of the island is a Dutch constituent country known as Sint Maarten. Relations between the two countries date back to the 17th and 18th centuries when a conflict led to the transformation of the Dutch Republic to the Batavian Republic and eventually the Kingdom of Holland. The two countries currently enjoy close cultural and economic relations. Both nations are members of the OECD, as well as founding members of the European Union, NATO, and the United Nations.\n\n[War of 1812] The War of 1812 (18121815) was a conflict fought between the United States, the United Kingdom, and their respective allies. Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theater of the Napoleonic Wars; in the United States and Canada, it is seen as a war in its own right.\n\n[Philip Wadsworth] Philip Wadsworth (March 7, 1832 – September 12, 1901) was an American dry goods merchant, politician, and military leader. Born to the prominent Wadsworth family in New Hartford, Connecticut, he attended private academies until he was sixteen, when he entered the dry goods trade. In 1853, he moved to Chicago, Illinois to join his brother in his dry goods operation, eventually rising to become president of Philip Wadsworth & Co., a clothing store. Wadsworth was also interested in the military, and although he never officially served, he maintained a military company where soldiers could train in advance of the Civil War. Later in his life he returned to Connecticut where he served a two-year term in the Connecticut House of Representatives.\n\n[Covered interest arbitrage] Covered interest arbitrage is an arbitrage trading strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on the interest rate differential between two countries by using a forward contract to \"cover\" (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Using forward contracts enables arbitrageurs such as individual investors or banks to make use of the forward premium (or discount) to earn a riskless profit from discrepancies between two countries' interest rates. The opportunity to earn riskless profits arises from the reality that the interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold. When spot and forward exchange rate markets are not in a state of equilibrium, investors will no longer be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries and will invest in whichever currency offers a higher rate of return. Economists have discovered various factors which affect the occurrence of deviations from covered interest rate parity and the fleeting nature of covered interest arbitrage opportunities, such as differing characteristics of assets, varying frequencies of time series data, and the transaction costs associated with arbitrage trading strategies.\n\n[E. S. Wadsworth] Elisha Strong Wadsworth (May 10, 1813 – November 25, 1890) was a merchant from New Hartford, Connecticut. He co-founded the Wadsworth, Dyer & Chapin company in Chicago, Illinois with his brother Julius and Thomas Dyer. The operation was one of the first successful firms in Chicago, trading in dry goods, grain, and packaged meat. Wadsworth was also the president of the Chicago and Aurora Railroad, later serving on the board of directors of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad when the two lines were merged. Wadsworth also served as a director of a predecessor to the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Wadsworth is the namesake of Wadsworth, Illinois.\n\n[Saudi Arabia–United States relations] Bilateral relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States began in 1933 when full diplomatic relations were established. Despite the differences between the two countries—an ultraconservative Islamic absolute monarchy, and a secular, democratic republic—the two countries have been allies. In recent years, the two countries have occasionally been described as having a \"Special Relationship\" with one another. Former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have close and strong relations with senior members of the Saudi Royal Family.\n\n[France–United Kingdom relations] France–United Kingdom relations are the relations between the governments of the French Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK). The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex, including conquest, wars, and alliances at various points in history. The Roman era saw both areas, except Scotland and Northern Ireland, conquered by Rome, whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day, and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas; however, the language barrier remained. The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history, as well as the English language. In the medieval period, the countries were often bitter enemies, with both nations' monarchs claiming control over France. The Hundred Years' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory. Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815. After that there were some tensions, but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed, the relationship became better. Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale, particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II, wherein both countries fought against Germany, and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis. Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO. In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship, especially on defence and foreign policy issues; the two countries tend, however, to disagree on a range of other matters, most notably the European Union. The British press relishes the chance to refer to France and Britain as \"historic rivals\" or emphasize the perceived ever-lasting competition that still opposes the two countries.\n\n[Malawi–Mozambique relations] Malawi–Mozambique relations refers to the current and historical relationship between the countries of Malawi and Mozambique. As Malawi shares a large border with Mozambique, much of the substance of their foreign relations pertain to the border separating the two nations. Both of the sovereign states have amicably agreed that lacustrine borders on Lake Malawi remain the largest priority between the two countries, as the exploitation of natural resources within the waters of Lake Malawi remain an issue the two countries continue to resolve. The moment considered an act of generosity and sympathy within the two countries relations is when, during the Mozambique Civil War, Malawi housed over one million Mozambican refugees between 1985 and 1995. After this gesture, Malawian relations with Mozambique crumbled under the tenure of Bingu wa Mutharika, notoriously reaching a nadir when Malawian police launched a raid into Mozambique's territory.\n\n[Soviet Union–United States relations] The relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (1922–1991) succeeded the previous relations from 1776 to 1917 and predate today's relations that began in 1992. Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established late due to mutual hostility. During World War II, the two countries were briefly allies. At the end of the war, the first signs of post-war mistrust and hostility began to appear between the two countries, escalating into the Cold War; a period of tense hostile relations, with periods of détente.\n\nQuestion: Alexander S.

Roughly 150 mi north of New York City, Albany developed on the west bank of the Hudson River, about 10 mi south of its confluence with the Mohawk River. The population of the City of Albany was 97,856 according to the 2010 census. Albany constitutes the economic and cultural core of the Capital District of New York State, which comprises the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area, including the nearby cities and suburbs of Troy, Schenectady, and Saratoga Springs. With a 2013 Census-estimated population of 1.1 million the Capital District is the third-most populous metropolitan region in the state and 38th in the United States.\n\n[Cottekill, New York] Cottekill is a small hamlet in the northwest part of the Town of Rosendale, Ulster county, New York in the United States. Located in the Rondout Valley, it is approximately 2.25 miles east of the hamlet of Stone Ridge, 2.5 miles northwest of Rosendale Village, 8.75 miles south of the city of Kingston and 10.9 miles north of the village of New Paltz.

There is also the Marbletown-Rosendale Rail Trail, curving along the old New York, Ontario and Western Railway tracks, paralleling Lucas Avenue. It starts at Leggett Road, crosses the Cottekill Creek on a wooden footbridge and travels north to Cottekill Road, past the Cottekill Fire House. It continues north from the firehouse, along the O & W path, crosses Marcott Road and comes out on Route 209.\n\n[United States Post Office (Geneva, New York)] US Post Office—Geneva is a historic post office building located at Geneva in Ontario County, New York. It is a symmetrically massed one story structure faced with red brick and trimmed in limestone. It was constructed in 1905-1906 and is the first post office constructed in New York state in the Colonial Revival style. It is one of 13 post offices in New York State designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department under James Knox Taylor. The entrance portico features four Doric columns supporting a full Doric entabulature and pediment with an oculus in its tympanum. The interior features a mural titled \"The Vineyard\" by Peter Blume and installed in 1942.\n\n[Owney (dog)] Owney (ca. 1887 – June 11, 1897), was a stray Border terrier adopted as the first unofficial postal mascot by the Albany, New York, post office about 1888. The Albany mail professionals recommended the dog to their Railway Mail Service colleagues, and he became a nationwide mascot for 9 years (1888–97). He traveled throughout the 48 contiguous United States and voyaged around the world traveling over 140,000 miles in his lifetime as a mascot of the Railway Post Office and the United States Postal Service. He is best known for being the subject of commemorative activities, including a 2011 U.S. postage stamp.\n\n[New York Postmaster's Provisional] The New York Postmaster's Provisional is, as its designation implies, a postage stamp provided by the New York Post Office to facilitate the prepayment of mail at a time when the United States had not yet issued postage stamps for national use. Placed on sale on July 14, 1845, this was the nation’s first provisional stamp to be issued by a local post office in response to the congressional postal reform act that had taken effect two weeks earlier. That law, passed on March 3, 1845, standardized nationwide mail rates, with the result that the use of stamps became a practical and reliable method of postal prepayment. (Before standardization, the many different postal rates in different jurisdictions had made fees too unpredictable to prepay all letters with stamps as a matter of course, with the result that recipients of letters--rather than senders--generally paid the postage on them.) Baltimore announced the issue of a provisional stamp one day after New York, on July 15, and New Haven soon followed. The New York issue has been cited as \"the most elegantly executed and widely used of the group of provisionals issued by eleven different [U. S. post] offices between 1845 and 1847.\"\n\n[United States Post Office–Bronx Central Annex] United States Post Office–Bronx Central Annex is a historic post office building located at the Bronx, New York, United States.

The building was sold in 2014 and is being transformed into retail, postal service, office and restaurant space.\n\n[Last Chance, Colorado] Last Chance is an unincorporated community in Washington County, Colorado, United States. Last Chance is situated at the intersection of U.S. Highway 36 and State Highway 71 in a sparsely populated area of eastern Colorado. The town was supposedly so named because it was once the only place for travelers to secure fuel and provisions for many miles in any direction. The U.S. Post Office at Woodrow (ZIP Code 80757) now serves Last Chance postal addresses.\n\n[Postmaster of New York City] A post office may have operated in New York City as early as 1687. The United States Postal Service has no information on New York's postmasters prior to the year 1775. The New York City Post Office is first mentioned in Hugh Finlay's journal dated 1773 which lists Alexander Colden as the postmaster of New York City. Other sources indicate that Colden may have served as postmaster as early as 1753. Postmasters are appointed by the President of the United States.\n\n[Sunderland, Maryland] Sunderland is a small, rural unincorporated community located at the crossroads of MD 2, MD 4, MD 262, Dalrymple Road, and Pushaw Station Road in Calvert County, Maryland, approximately 5 miles south of Dunkirk, Maryland and 10 miles north of Prince Frederick, Maryland. Although Sunderland is not incorporated and does not have a central business district, it does have a zip code, 20689. However, as of November 2007, the former Sunderland post office had closed its doors due to a lease dispute without opening a new location, and postal officials are determining where to locate a new post office location.\n\n[London Penny Post] The London Penny Post was a premier postal system whose function was to deliver mail within London and its immediate suburbs for the modest sum of one penny. The Penny Post was established in 1680 by William Dockwra and his business partner, Robert Murray. Dockwra was a merchant and a member of the Armourer and Brasiers Livery Company and was appointed a Customs Under-Searcher for the Port of London in 1663. Murray would later become clerk in the excise office of the Penny Post. The London Penny Post mail service was launched with weeks of publicity preceding it on 27 March 1680. The new London Penny Post provided the city of London with a much needed inter-city mail delivery system. The new Penny Post was influential in establishing a model system and pattern for the various Provincial English Penny Posts in the years that followed. It was the first postal system to use hand-stamps to postmark the mail to indicate the place and time of the mailing and that its postage had been prepaid. The success of the Penny Post would also threaten the interests of the Duke of York who profited directly from the existing general post office. It also compromised the business interests of porters and private couriers. The Penny Post was also involved in publishing various criticisms towards the British monarchy, the Duke of York in particular, which ultimately led to the take over of the Penny Post by crown authorities. The earliest known Penny Post postmark is dated 13 December 1680 and is considered by some to be the world's first postage 'stamp'.\n\nQuestion: Owney was a stray terrier adopted as the first unofficial postal mascot by a post office that is roughly how many miles north of New York City?",

Martin began his career as a solo artist in October 2005, when The Tea Party went on hiatus.\n\n[Jeff Martin 777] Jeff Martin 777 was a rock band from Perth, Western Australia. The band's name was inspired by Jeff Martin's study of the occult, specifically the work of Aleister Crowley. Martin formed the band with former Sleepy Jackson members Malcolm Clark and Jay Cortez in 2010, after the demise of his previous band The Armada. The band ended in 2012 after the re-activation of Martin's former group The Tea Party in 2011.\n\n[Billy Corgan] William Patrick \"Billy\" Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967) is an American musician, songwriter, producer, poet, and entrepreneur.

Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000.

The song contains an extended guitar solo, inspired by Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, recorded live by Billy Corgan. Written on an acoustic guitar, Corgan left the meaning of the song vague, but later realized it has a lot to do with his relationship with his father. Corgan consciously set the song in 1975, the year he started listening heavily to rock music, considering Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, UFO, and Rainbow influences on the sound.\n\n[Starchildren] Starchildren was a side project of The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan.

According to Corgan, the whistling sound (feedback) heard in \"Mayonaise\" came from a cheap guitar he bought, which, whenever he stopped playing it, created the whistling sound. This sound was then incorporated into the song. Corgan apparently got the title for the song after he looked \"in [his] refrigerator\".\n\n[Voodoo Highway] Voodoo Highway is the second album of the band Badlands.

        "body_text": "Context:\n[Wasei-kango] Wasei-kango (Japanese: 和製漢語 , \"Japanese-made Chinese words\") refers to words in the Japanese language composed of Chinese morphemes but invented in Japan rather than borrowed from China. Such terms are generally written using kanji and read according to the \"on'yomi\" pronunciations of the characters. While many words belong to the shared Sino-Japanese vocabulary, some \"kango\" do not exist in Chinese while others have a substantially different meaning from Chinese, however some words have been borrowed back to Chinese.\n\n[List of English Latinates of Germanic origin] Many words in the English lexicon are made up of Latinate words; that is, words which have entered the English language from a Romance language (usually Anglo-Norman), or were borrowed directly from Latin. Quite a few of these words can further trace their origins back to a Germanic source (usually Frankish), making them cognate with many native English words from Old English, yielding etymological twins. Many of these are Franco-German words, or French words of Germanic origin.\n\n[Flash fiction] Flash fiction is fictional work of extreme brevity, that still offers character and plot development, including the , 140-character stories, also known as \"twitterature\", the \"dribble\" (50 words), the \"drabble\" , also known as \"microfiction\"(100 words), \"sudden fiction\" (750 words), flash fiction (1000 words), and \"micro-story\". Some commentators have also suggested that some flash fiction possesses a unique literary quality, e.g. the ability to hint at or imply a larger story.\n\n[Knock (short story)] \"Knock\", written by Fredric Brown, is a science fiction short story that starts with a short-short story based on the following text of Thomas Bailey Aldrich:\n\n[Circumlocution] Circumlocution (also called circumduction, circumvolution, periphrasis, or ambage) is speech that circles around an idea with many words instead of stating it directly and simply. It is sometimes necessary in communication (for example, to avoid lexical gaps that would cause untranslatability), but it can also be undesirable (when an uncommon or easily misunderstood figure of speech is used). Roundabout speech is the use of many words to describe something that already has a common and concise term (for example, saying \"\"a tool used for cutting things such as paper and hair\"\" instead of \"scissors\"). Most dictionaries use circumlocution to define words. Circumlocution is often used by people with aphasia and people learning a new language, where simple terms can be paraphrased to aid learning or communication (for example, paraphrasing the word \"grandfather\" as \"the father of one's father\"). Euphemism, innuendo, and equivocation are different forms of circumlocution.\n\n[How Many Words] \"How Many Words\" is the official second single by the singer-songwriter Blake Lewis, from his debut album \"A.D.D. (Audio Day Dream)\". The song was expected to be followed by \"Know My Name\", and then \"Without You\". However, due to being dropped by Arista Records, \"How Many Words\" is the final single from his debut album. He is expected to release a single from his second album at the end of 2009. The single was released to mainstream radio format on March 10, 2008. Also, an EP featuring remixes of the song was released onto iTunes on May 13, 2008. Lewis performed the song live on the March 6, 2008 results show of the seventh season of \"American Idol\".\n\n[Verbal fluency test] Verbal fluency tests are a kind of psychological test in which participants have to produce as many words as possible from a category in a given time (usually 60 seconds). This category can be semantic, including objects such as animals or fruits, or phonemic, including words beginning with a specified letter, such as \"p\", for example.\n\n[Changes to Old English vocabulary] Many words that existed in Old English did not survive into Modern English. There are also many words in Modern English that bear little or no resemblance in meaning to their Old English etymons. Some linguists estimate that as much as 80 percent of the lexicon of Old English was lost by the end of the Middle English period, including a large number of words formed by compounding, e.g. \"bōchūs\" ('bookhouse', 'library'), yet we still retain the component parts 'book' and 'house'. Certain categories of words seem to have been especially vulnerable. Nearly all words relating to sexual intercourse and sexual organs were supplanted by words of Latin or Ancient Greek origin. Many, if not most, of the words in Modern English that are used in polite conversation to describe body parts and bodily functions are of Latin or Greek origin. The words which were used in Old English for these same purposes are now mostly either extinct or considered crude or vulgar, such as arse/ass.\n\n[Esperanto vocabulary] The word base of Esperanto was originally defined by \"Lingvo internacia\", published by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. It contained some 900 root words. The rules of the language allow speakers to borrow words as needed, recommending only that they look for the most international words, and that they borrow one basic word and derive others from it, rather than borrowing many words with related meanings. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, \"Universala vortaro\", which was written in five languages and supplied a larger set of root words.\n\n[List of English words of Scots origin] List of English words of Scots origin is a list of English language words of Scots origin.

The decision called upon the antiquated Rule of 1756, which stated that neutral nations in wartime were only permitted to carry goods that they were permitted to carry in peacetime. \"Essex\" was ruled to have violated the Rule of 1756. This led to a sharp increase in British seizure of American ships by the same reasoning and was one of the leading causes of the War of 1812.\n\n[Li Yang (Crazy English)] Li Yang (; born 1969 in Changzhou, Jiangsu) is a Chinese educator and language instructor.

Still further west is the Tortugas Bank, which is submerged. The first Europeans to discover the islands were the Spanish in 1513, led by explorer Juan Ponce de León. They are an unincorporated area of Monroe County, Florida, and belong to the Lower Keys Census County Division. With their surrounding waters, they constitute the Dry Tortugas National Park.\n\n[Florida Reef] The Florida Reef (also known as the Great Florida Reef, Florida reefs, Florida Reef Tract and Florida Keys Reef Tract) is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States.

The barrier reef tract forms a great arc, concentric with the Florida Keys, with the northern end, in Biscayne National Park, oriented north-south and the western end, south of the Marquesas Keys, oriented east-west. The rest of the reef outside Biscayne National Park lies within John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Isolated coral patch reefs occur northward from Biscayne National Park as far as Stuart, in Martin County. Coral reefs are also found in Dry Tortugas National Park west of the Marquesas Keys.

        "body_text": "Context:\n[Waterloo Bridge] Waterloo Bridge ( ) is a road and foot traffic bridge crossing the River Thames in London, between Blackfriars Bridge and Hungerford Bridge. Its name commemorates the victory of the British, the Dutch and the Prussians at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Thanks to its location at a strategic bend in the river, the views from the bridge (of Westminster, the South Bank and the London Eye to the west, and of the City of London and Canary Wharf to the east) are widely held to be the finest from any spot in London at ground level.\n\n[York Road, Lambeth] York Road is a road in Lambeth, London, running between Westminster Bridge Road (south) and Waterloo Road (north). To the west is the old County Hall, Shell Centre, Jubilee Gardens and, beyond, the London Eye and the River Thames. Waterloo station is located on the road's eastern edge, as well as the former Waterloo International Eurostar terminal and General Lying-In Hospital. The London IMAX cinema is located within the Bullring roundabout at the northern end of the road, on a site previously occupied by Cardboard City for the homeless.\n\n[Waterloo Road, London] Waterloo Road is the main road in the Waterloo district of London, England straddling the boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark.

Consequent on an idea of Joanna Lumley, Thomas Heatherwick worked with Arup on a proposal by Transport for London (TfL) for a new bridge across the Thames between Waterloo and Blackfriars bridges. The proposed concrete, steel, cupronickel clad structure was intended to carry pedestrians, with no cycles or other vehicles. It was to have been located some 200 m from Waterloo Bridge and 300 m from Blackfriars Bridge, and have included some areas of planting. The project included a commercial building, built on former green space at the southern end of the bridge. The bridge could only be funded by raising over £140 million of private money (including charitable gift aid) and £60 million of promised public money, of which £30m was from Transport for London (£20m of this to be repaid over 55 years) and £30m from the Department for Transport, adding up to projected funding of over £200m in total, In January 2017 the trustees of the prospective owner of the bridge stated that costs would \"substantially exceed\" an earlier revised total of £185m and in April 2017 the report by Margaret Hodge (below) concluded, on the basis of the Garden Bridge Trust's own evidence to her, that the cost would be over £200m.\n\n[London Eye] The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London.

The caucus lists four points as \"key strategic principles in furthering the work of the Libertarian Party toward, as our platform describes it, 'a world set free in our lifetime'.\" These are: Rights Are Utilitarian, Radical Abolitionism, Principled Populism, and No Particular Order (for removal of government policies). The caucus was active at the 2008 and 2010 Libertarian National Conventions. The radical caucus was revived and was extraordinarily active during the 2016 Libertarian National Convention.\n\n[David Bergland] David Peter Bergland (born June 4, 1935) is an American politician who was the United States Libertarian Party's nominee at the 1983 Libertarian National Convention for President of the United States in the 1984 presidential election.\n\n[2012 Libertarian National Convention] The 2012 United States Libertarian National Convention, in which delegates of the Libertarian Party (LP) chose the party's nominees for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in the 2012 general election, was held May 2–6, 2012 in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Red Rock Resort Spa and Casino. Former Governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson won the presidential nomination on the first ballot. Retired California state court judge Jim Gray won the vice-presidential nomination, also on the first ballot. The convention also chose to replace most of the Libertarian National Committee party officers and members-at-large.\n\n[Political positions of Gary Johnson] Gary Johnson was the governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003 and ran for president in 2012 and 2016. In December 2011 he announced he would pursue the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party for the 2012 general election. The Libertarian National Convention in May, 2012 chose Johnson as the party's candidate. In November 2014, Johnson announced he would pursue the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party for the 2016 general election. Johnson has taken positions on many political issues as revealed through his public comments, his gubernatorial record, his Our America Initiative and his campaigns to win the Republican and Libertarian nominations.\n\n[Gary Johnson] Gary Earl Johnson (born January 1, 1953) is an American businessman, author, and politician. He was the 29th Governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003 as a member of the Republican Party. He was also the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 and 2016 elections.\n\n[Libertarian Party presidential primaries, 2016] The 2016 Libertarian Party presidential primaries and caucuses allowed electors to indicate non-binding preferences for the Libertarian Party's presidential candidate. These differed from the Republican or Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses in that they did not appoint delegates to represent a candidate at the party's convention to select the party's nominee for the United States presidential election. The party's nominee for the 2016 presidential election was chosen directly by registered delegates at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention, which ran from May 26 to 30, 2016. The delegates nominated former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld.\n\n[Gary Johnson presidential campaign, 2012] The 2012 presidential campaign of Gary Johnson, the 29th Governor of New Mexico, was announced on April 21, 2011. He declared his candidacy for the 2012 Republican Party nomination for President of the United States. On December 28, 2011, Johnson withdrew his candidacy for the Republican nomination, and declared his candidacy for the 2012 presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party. The 2012 Libertarian National Convention was held during the first weekend of May 2012. On May 5, 2012, after promoting his libertarian-oriented political positions to delegates, Johnson received the most votes at the convention and became the official 2012 Libertarian presidential nominee. On November 6, 2012, Johnson received just under 1% of the popular vote in the general election, amounting to more than 1.2 million votes, more than double what the Barr/Root ticket received in 2008. This was the most successful result for a third-party presidential candidacy since 2000, and the best in the Libertarian Party's history by vote number at the time. (Johnson ran again in 2016 and received nearly four times his 2012 vote total.)\n\n[Mark Hinkle] Mark Hinkle (born January 28, 1951) is an American libertarian activist and businessperson. He was the National Chairman of the United States Libertarian Party until 2012. He was elected by the delegates of the 2010 Libertarian National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri on May 30, 2010.\n\n[Libertarian National Committee] The Libertarian National Committee (LNC) controls and manages the affairs, properties, and funds of the United States Libertarian Party. It is composed of the party officers, five at-large representatives elected every two years at the national convention, and a theoretical maximum of 10 regional representatives. The current chair, elected in June 2014, is Nicholas Sarwark. The Executive Director is Wes Benedict.\n\n[Libertarian National Convention] The Libertarian National Convention is held every two years by the Libertarian Party (United States) to choose members of the Libertarian National Committee (LNC), and to conduct other party business. In presidential election years, the convention delegates enact a platform and nominate the Libertarian presidential and vice-presidential candidates who then face the nominees of other parties in the November general election.\n\nQuestion: Which former Republican won the presidential nomination at the 2012 United States Libertarian National Convention?

It came less than three months after Minh's junta had themselves come to power in a bloody coup against then President Ngô Đình Diệm. The coup was bloodless and took less than a few hours—after power had been seized Minh's aide and bodyguard, Major Nguyễn Văn Nhung was arrested and summarily executed.\n\n[Ngo Dinh Diem] Ngô Đình Diệm (] ; 3 January 1901 – 2 November 1963) was a South Vietnamese politician.

        "body_text": "Context:\n[Labyrinthodontia] Labyrinthodontia (Greek, \"maze-toothed\") is an extinct amphibian subclass, which constituted some of the dominant animals of late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras (about 390 to 150 million years ago). The group evolved from lobe-finned fishes in the Devonian and is ancestral to all extant landliving vertebrates. As such it constitutes an evolutionary grade (a paraphyletic group) rather than a natural group (clade). The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth, which are often the only part of the creatures that fossilize. They are also distinguished by a heavily armoured skull roof (hence the older name \"Stegocephalia\"), and complex vertebrae, the structure of which is useful in older classifications of the group.\n\n[Blue on Blue (Bobby Vinton album)] Blue on Blue is Bobby Vinton's sixth studio album, released in 1963. Cover versions include the jazz songs \"St. Louis Blues\" and \"Blueberry Hill\", \"Am I Blue\", \"Blue, Blue Day\", the Fleetwoods' hit \"Mr. Blue\", \"My Blue Heaven\", three show tunes (\"Blue Skies\", \"Blue Hawaii\" and \"Blue Moon\"), and The Clovers Rhythm and blues hit, \"Blue Velvet\".\n\n[Rock-A-Hula Baby] \"Rock-A-Hula Baby \" is a song performed by Elvis Presley for the 1961 movie \"Blue Hawaii\". Written by Ben Weisman, Fred Wise, and Dolores Fuller, it is a genre mix of Hawaiian folk and rock and roll. It was the first song published by Fuller, who would eventually co-write a dozen songs for Presley.\n\n[Perger] Perger is a surname, which is an older version of \"Berger\". The first letter did not change from \"P\" to \"B\", which was common in the late Middle Ages. The word \"Perg\" or later \"Berg\" means mountain, so the name describes someone, who lived on a mountain. Mostly that persons were related to the government, or they were the governor of their region one millennium ago. Someone in this position was the lord of the mountain. In old German language that would be the \"Herr vom Perg\" or the \"Pergherr\", which is the origin of \"Perger\". The name comes quite likely from the German-speaking part of the Alps, which is Austria (with its languages Burgenland Croatian, Slovene, Hungarian, Czech, Slovak, and Romani), Germany (Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg), South Tyrol in Italy (with its languages German, Italian, and Ladin), and Switzerland (with its languages German, French, Italian, and Romansh), but it could be originated everywhere in the German language area, where a hill or a mountain was populated. In comparison to the name \"Berger\" it is rather rare. A similar even rarer name with the same meaning is \"Pergher\" or \"Bergher\", still displaying the \"h\". The reason for the varying spellings is the development of the German language in different regions of the German language area and its regions of language transitions in the last thousand years.\n\n[Blue Hawaii (drink)] The Blue Hawaii is a tropical cocktail made of rum, pineapple juice, Curaçao, sweet and sour mix, and sometimes vodka as well. It should not be confused with the similarly named Blue Hawaiian cocktail (also known as the Swimming Pool cocktail) that contains creme of coconut instead of sweet and sour mix.\n\n[Baby Guinness] A Baby Guinness is a shooter, a style of cocktail, or mixed alcoholic beverage, intended to be consumed in one shot.

The name describes the effectiveness of the fort.\n\n[Saliou] Saliou is an African name, originating from the Fulani tribe. Saliou doesn't really have a true meaning in western languages. The name describes a moment of the day, like mid-day or start of the afternoon, a perfect temperature, not too hot nor too cold a moment of peace. the bearer of such name is often lookup up to as noble, a source of luck, bearer of a good news.\n\n[Blue Hawaii (Elvis Presley album)] Blue Hawaii is the fourteenth album by American singer and musician Elvis Presley, released on RCA Victor Records in mono and stereo, LPM/LSP 2426, on October 20, 1961.

        "body_text": "Context:\n[New Jersey Route 60] Route 60 was a proposed limited access state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It would have run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge in the Deepwater neighborhood of Pennsville Township to Ocean City. The freeway was to parallel U.S. Route 40 from its start, then run as a concurrency with Route 55 in Vineland. From there it would have continued east and ended at Ocean City. It was designed as a connection between South Jersey and points west via the Delaware Memorial Bridge. However, the nearby Atlantic City Expressway, combined with a fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s, prevented the freeway from being built.\n\n[Betsy Ross Bridge] The Betsy Ross Bridge, also known as the Ross Memorial Bridge is a continuous steel truss bridge spanning the Delaware River from the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania to Pennsauken, New Jersey. Built from 1969 to 1974, and opened in April 1976, during the American Bicentennial Year, it was originally planned to be named as the \"Delair Bridge\", after a paralleling vertical lift bridge owned by Pennsylvania Railroad (which is now used by Conrail and New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Line), but was instead later named for Betsy Ross, a Philadelphia seamstress and reputed creator of the first American flag in 1776, making it the first automotive bridge named for a woman in America and the second bridge overall (after Iowa's Boone High Bridge was renamed the Kate Shelley High Bridge in 1912).\n\n[Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge] The Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge is a four-lane, steel, arch-shaped, continuous truss bridge that connects the Pennsylvania Turnpike's East-West Mainline with the main trunk of the New Jersey Turnpike, via the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension (formerly known as the Pennsylvania Extension). The bridge crosses the Delaware River, connecting Bristol Township, Pennsylvania and Burlington Township, New Jersey. The bridge was closed to traffic on January 20, 2017, after a crack was discovered in a steel truss; it reopened on March 9 of that year.\n\n[Interstate 295 (Delaware–New Jersey)] Interstate 295 (abbreviated I-295) in New Jersey and Delaware is an auxiliary Interstate Highway, designated as a bypass around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The route begins at a junction with I-95 south of Wilmington, Delaware, and runs to another junction with I-95 north of Trenton, New Jersey. The highway heads east from I-95 and crosses the Delaware River from Delaware to New Jersey on the Delaware Memorial Bridge concurrent with U.S. Route 40 (US 40). Upon entering New Jersey, the two routes split and I-295 runs parallel to the New Jersey Turnpike for most of its course in the state. After a concurrency with US 130 in Gloucester County, I-295 has an interchange with I-76 and Route 42 in Camden County. The freeway continues northeast toward Trenton, where it intersects I-195 and Route 29 before bypassing the city to the east and ending at US 1 in Lawrence Township, where the road becomes I-95 southbound.\n\n[Simeon Willis Memorial Bridge] Simeon Willis Memorial Bridge is a bridge constructed in 1985 over the Ohio River connecting Winchester Ave. (US 23) and 13th St. (US 60) at Ashland, Kentucky to US 52 at Coal Grove, Ohio. It is named for Kentucky Governor Simeon S. Willis. The bridge was planned, at one point, to cross at 45th St. and connect to a proposed Ashland bypass. The Willis bridge, however, was built one block from the existing Ben Williamson Memorial Bridge and generally carries only Ohio-bound traffic. Southbound traffic, which is normally carried on the Williamson Bridge, was diverted to the Willis Bridge in early 2007 so that the Williamson Bridge could be repaired and painted. The Williamson Bridge was also closed briefly and traffic again diverted to the Willis Bridge in the summer of 2013 after a tractor-trailer ran into the tower on the Ohio side.\n\n[Nevius Street Bridge] The Nevius Street Bridge once carried car traffic across the Raritan River between Hillsborough Township and Raritan Borough in Somerset County, New Jersey, United States. In the 1840s a wooden bridge crossed at this location. The current 150 ft bridge was built in 1886 by the Wrought Iron Bridge Company of Canton, Ohio. It is a double intersection Pratt truss bridge. The construction of the nearby John Basilone Veterans Memorial Bridge replaced the Nevius Street Bridge in 2005; the bridge now serves as a pedestrian bridge, connecting River Road in Hillsborough with the Raritan River Greenway. Joannes Nevius was born in Zoelen, Netherlands, in 1627 and emigrated to New Amsterdam in 1651. His grandson, Petrus or Peter Nevius, was the first with the Nevius name to come to the Raritan Valley in Somerset County.\n\n[New Jersey Turnpike] The New Jersey Turnpike (NJTP), colloquially known to New Jerseyans as \"the Turnpike\", is a toll road in New Jersey, maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. According to the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, the Turnpike is the nation's sixth-busiest toll road and is one of the most heavily traveled highways in the United States. Having a total length of 122.40 mi , the Turnpike's southern terminus begins at Interstate 295 (I-295) near the border of Pennsville and Carneys Point Townships in Salem County, one mile east of the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Its northern terminus is located at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, Bergen County. The Turnpike is a major thoroughfare providing access to various localities in New Jersey, as well as Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York. The route divides into four roadways between exit 6 and exit 14, with the inner lanes restricted to carrying only cars, and with the outer lanes for cars, trucks and buses.\n\n[Veteran's Memorial Bridge (Portland, Maine)] Veteran's Memorial Bridge is a bridge connecting the cities of Portland, Maine and South Portland, Maine. The bridge spans the Fore River and is part of U.S. Route 1. The original Veteran's Memorial Bridge was built in 1954 and was described as 'rapidly deteriorating' prior to its demolition. Designated a top infrastructure priority by Maine state government, a new bridge was built beginning in 2010. The new bridge was completed on November 30, 2012. General contractor Reed & Reed of Woolwich, Maine was awarded the rebuilding contractor. Reed & Reed estimated the new bridge would stand for 100 years.\n\n[Betsy Ross flag] The Betsy Ross flag is an early design of the flag of the United States, popularly but very likely incorrectly attributed to Betsy Ross, using the common motifs of alternating red-and-white striped field with five-pointed stars in a blue canton. The first documented usage of this flag was in 1792. The flag features 13 stars to represent the original 13 colonies with the stars arranged in a circle.\n\n[Interstate 95 in New Jersey] Interstate 95 (I-95) is a major Interstate Highway that traverses nearly the full extent of the East Coast of the United States, from Florida to Maine, with the exception of a small gap in New Jersey. In New Jersey, it runs along much of the main line of the New Jersey Turnpike (Exit 6 to Exit 14), as well as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension (formerly and still commonly known as the Pennsylvania Turnpike Connector; from Exit 6 to the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge) and the New Jersey Turnpike's northern continuation (from Exit 14) to the George Washington Bridge, also maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, for a total of 77.96 mi . Located in the northeastern part of the state near New York City, the 11.03 mi Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike, considered to be Route 95W by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, is also part of I-95. There is also a segment of I-95 to the north of Trenton that is 8.77 mi and connects the Scudder Falls Bridge to I-295 and U.S. Route 1 (US 1); this is officially Route 95M.\n\nQuestion: What flag features 13 stars, and has a creator who also has a memorial bridge named after her connecting Pennsylvania and New Jersey?",

In concept, it is relatively comparable to the Hawker Sea Hurricane, a navalised version of the Spitfire's stablemate, the Hawker Hurricane. The name Seafire had been derived from the abbreviation of the longer name Sea Spitfire.\n\n[Flying Legend Hawker Hurricane Replica] The Flying Legend Hawker Hurricane Replica is an Italian light-sport aircraft, designed and produced by Flying Legend of Caltagirone and introduced at the AERO Friedrichshafen show in 2011. The aircraft, a 72% scale replica of the British Hawker Hurricane Second World War fighter, is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.\n\n[Hawker Typhoon] The Hawker Typhoon (Tiffy in RAF slang), is a British single-seat fighter-bomber, produced by Hawker Aircraft. It was intended to be a medium–high altitude interceptor, as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane but several design problems were encountered and it never completely satisfied this requirement.\n\n[Hawker Hurricane in Yugoslav service] The Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) operated the British Hawker Hurricane Mk I fighter aircraft from 1938 to 1941. Between 1938 and 1940, the VVKJ obtained 24 Hurricane Mk I's from early production batches, marking the first foreign sale of the aircraft. Twenty additional aircraft were built by Zmaj under licence in Yugoslavia. When the country was drawn into World War II by the German-led Axis invasion of April 1941, a total of 41 Hurricane Mk I's were in service as fighters. They achieved some successes against \"Luftwaffe\" aircraft, but all Yugoslav Hurricanes were destroyed or captured during the 11-day invasion.\n\n[No. 1300 Flight RAF] No. 1300 (Meteorological) Flight was formed on 31 July 1943 at RAF Alipore, West Bengal, British India, by re-designating No. 1 Meteorological Flight RAF.

It stars Jackie Chan, Steve Coogan and Cécile de France. The film is set in 19th-century Britain and centers on Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan), here reimagined as an eccentric inventor, and his efforts to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. During the trip, he is accompanied by his Chinese valet, Passepartout (Jackie Chan). For comedic reasons, the film intentionally deviated wildly from the novel and included a number of anachronistic elements. With production costs of about $110 million and estimated marketing costs of $30 million, it earned $24 million at the U.S. box office and $72 million worldwide, making it a box office flop. It was Arnold Schwarzenegger's last film before he took a hiatus from acting to become Governor of California until 2010's \"The Expendables\".\n\n[Jules Verne Trophy] The Jules Verne Trophy is a prize for the fastest circumnavigation of the world by any type of yacht with no restrictions on the size of the crew provided the vessel has registered with the organization and paid an entry fee. A vessel holding the Jules Verne trophy will not necessarily hold the absolute round the world record. The trophy was first awarded to the first yacht which sailed around the world in less than 80 days. The name of the award is a reference to the Jules Verne novel \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" in which Phileas Fogg traverses the planet (albeit by railroad and steamboat) in 80 days. The current holder is \"IDEC Sport\" skippered by Francis Joyon in 40 days 23 hours 30 minutes 30 seconds.\n\n[Michael Palin: Around the World in 80 Days] Around the World in 80 Days is a 7-part BBC television travel series first broadcast on BBC1 in 1989.

Palin was given the same deadline, and not allowed to use aircraft, which did not exist in Jules Verne's time and would make completing the journey far too easy. He followed Phileas Fogg's route as closely as possible. Along the way he commented on the sights and cultures he encountered. Palin encountered several setbacks during his voyage, partly because he travelled with a five-person film crew, who are collectively named after Passepartout, Phileas Fogg's manservant.\n\n[Ball of Fire] Ball of Fire is a 1941 American screwball comedy film directed by Howard Hawks and starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck.

The contest between the men featured a battle for control of the Democratic Party, and cast Humphrey's \"old politics\", against the \"new politics\" of McCarthy and Kennedy. The main cause of the division was the Vietnam War, which intensified during Humphrey's tenure as Vice President and grew increasingly unpopular.\n\n[Young Democrats of North Carolina] The Young Democrats of North Carolina are the official youth arm of the North Carolina Democratic Party (NCDP).

Following his exit from the gubernatorial race, he was appointed Vice President of Administrative Affairs of the University of Maryland, College Park, where he worked for 17 months. In 2014 he unsuccessfully ran for his old job as Montgomery County Executive. He lost to incumbent Ike Leggett in the Democratic Party primary.\n\n[1916 Republican National Convention] The 1916 Republican National Convention was held in Chicago from June 7 to June 10. A major goal of the party's bosses at the convention was to heal the bitter split within the party that had occurred in the 1912 presidential campaign. In that year, Theodore Roosevelt bolted the GOP and formed his own political party, the Progressive Party, which contained most of the GOP's liberals. William Howard Taft, the incumbent president, won the nomination of the regular Republican Party. This split in the GOP ranks divided the Republican vote and led to the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Although several candidates were openly competing for the 1916 nomination—most prominently conservative Senator Elihu Root of New York, Senator John W. Weeks of Massachusetts, and liberal Senator Albert Cummins of Iowa—the party's bosses wanted a moderate who would be acceptable to all factions of the party. They turned to Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who had served on the court since 1910 and thus had the advantage of not having publicly spoken about political issues in six years. Although he had not sought the nomination, Hughes made it known that he would not turn it down; he won the nomination on the third ballot. Former Vice-President Charles W. Fairbanks was nominated as his running mate. Hughes was the only Supreme Court Justice to be nominated for president by a major political party. Fairbanks (as of 2016) was the last former vice president, to be nominated for vice president.\n\n[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2012] The 2012 Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses were the process by which voters of the Democratic Party chose its nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.

Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to World War I. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief.\n\n[2005 BA-CA-TennisTrophy] The 2005 BA-CA-TennisTrophy was a tennis tournament played on indoor hard courts.

Beginning with the 14th Exhibition of the Vienna Sezession in 1902, the radical distinctiveness of certain Viennese artists began to emerge, setting a foundation for the widespread Modernist movement. Among the innovators was the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann. His cubist sculpture created in 1902 marked a break into independence for many Viennese artists. His works from this period are especially remarkable when one considers that the term \"cubism\" only found its way into the art lexicon around 1907 to describe the work of Pablo Picasso.\n\n[2006 BA-CA-TennisTrophy] The 2006 BA-CA-TennisTrophy was a tennis tournament played on indoor hard courts.

Goldberg] Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional. After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only. Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional. (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.) In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed.\n\n[One Rank, One Pension] One Rank One Pension (OROP), or \"same pension, for same rank, for same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement\", is a longstanding demand of the Indian armed forces and veterans. The demand for pay-pension equity, which underlies the OROP concept, was provoked by the exparte decision by the Indira Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) government, in 1973, two years after the historic victory in the 1971 Bangladesh war, and shortly after Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw retired, to decrease armed forces pensions by 20–40 percent, and increase civilian pensions by 20 percent, without consultation with armed forces headquarters. <ref name=\"V Mahalingam, 21/9\"> </ref>\n\n[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)] The Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS; French: \"chef d'état-major de la Défense\" ) is the second most senior member of the Canadian Armed Forces (after the commander-in-chief) and heads the Armed Forces Council, having primary responsibility for command, control, and administration of the forces, as well as military strategy, plans, and requirements.

The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act. It was the country's first peacetime draft. From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means. The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force. However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed.\n\n[Armed Forces Covenant] The Military Covenant or Armed Forces Covenant is a term introduced in 2000 into British public life to refer to the mutual obligations between the nation and its Armed Forces. According to \"The Guardian\", \"it is an informal understanding, rather than a legally enforceable deal, but it is nevertheless treated with great seriousness within the services\". It was coined in , and has now entered political discourse as a way of measuring whether the government and society at large have kept to their obligations to support members of the armed forces.\n\n[Armed Forces Day (Poland)] Armed Forces Day, known also as the Feast of the Polish Armed Forces (Polish: \"Święto Wojska Polskiego\" ), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw during the Polish–Soviet War. Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, itself a separate public holiday. The event is marked by military parades, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the Polish Armed Forces across the country. One of the most prominent events of the day is in the capital Warsaw, which hosts a large military parade through the city's center. Originally celebrated during the Second Republic, the holiday was barred by authorities during the communist era beginning in 1947, only to be revived again in 1992.\n\n[Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights] In June 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC). It was the most important federal move in support of the rights of African-Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin. The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts. Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result. The war brought the race issue to the forefront. The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War. But by 1940, the African-American vote had largely shifted from Republican to Democrat, and African-American leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League had become recognized as part of the Roosevelt coalition. In June 1941, at the urging of A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces. In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order — the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942. In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces. Roosevelt agreed, but then did nothing to implement his promise. It was left to his successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces.\n\nQuestion: Rostker v.

It created the current regime of bank secrecy that Swiss banks are famous for. Under the Law, it is a criminal act for a bank to reveal the name of an account holder. The law helped establish Switzerland as the premier tax haven for foreigners, with Swiss banks accounting for approximately US$2.1 trillion in offshore assets, 27% of the world's total. Since then, Swiss banks have acquired a reputation because of their numbered bank accounts, which critics such as ATTAC NGO alleged facilitate tax evasion, money laundering and more generally the underground economy.\n\n[Société de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie] Société de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie was the original name of the new holding company issued from the merger enforced by the Swiss Banks in 1983 of both the SSIH and ASUAG, now The Swatch Group (see  ).\n\n[Eberhard &amp; Co.] Eberhard & Co is a Swiss luxury watch company, founded in 1887 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Neuchâtel, Switzerland by Swiss watch making industrialist Georges Eberhard.\n\n[Jean Lassale] Jean Lassale was a Swiss watch company that designed the Calibre 1200, featuring the thinnest mechanical watch movement : 1.2 mm.

After the end of the war Churchill had to step down as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom because the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election. For six years he was to serve as the Leader of the Opposition. During these years Churchill continued to influence world affairs; in 1946 he gave his Iron Curtain speech which spoke of the expansionist policies of the USSR and the creation of the Eastern Bloc; Churchill also argued strongly for British independence from the European Coal and Steel Community (which he saw as a Franco-German project as Britain still had an empire). In the General Election of 1951 Labour was defeated and Churchill became Prime Minister for a second time. Churchill continued to lead Britain but was to suffer increasingly from health problems. Aware that he was slowing down both physically and mentally he resigned from the Cabinet in 1955. However he continued to sit as an MP for Woodford until he retired from politics in 1964. Churchill died on 24 January 1965 and was granted the honour of a state funeral. He was buried in his family plot in St Martin's Church, Bladon near to where he was born at Blenheim Palace.\n\n[United Kingdom local elections, 1991] Local elections were held in the United Kingdom in 1991. The results were a setback for the governing Conservative Party, who were left with their lowest number of councillors since 1973 - though their popular vote was an improvement from the 1990 local elections (John Major had succeeded Margaret Thatcher as prime minister in November 1990), and the Conservatives would go on to win the general election in 1992.\n\n[Margaret Thatcher] Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (née Roberts ; 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013) was a British stateswoman who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have been appointed. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.\n\n[John Major] Sir John Major, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (born 29 March 1943) is a British politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1990 to 1997.

In 1940, Attlee took Labour into the wartime coalition government and served under Winston Churchill, becoming the first person to hold the office of Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He went on to lead the Labour Party to an unexpected landslide victory at the 1945 general election; forming the first Labour majority government, and a mandate to implement its postwar reforms. The 12.0% national swing from the Conservatives to Labour was unprecedented at that time and remains the largest ever achieved by any party at a general election in British electoral history. He was re-elected with a narrow majority at the 1950 general election. In the following year, Attlee called a snap general election, hoping to increase his parliamentary majority. However, he was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives under the leadership of Winston Churchill; despite winning the most votes of any political party in any general election in British political history until the Conservative Party's fourth consecutive victory in 1992. Attlee remains the longest-ever serving Leader of the Labour Party.\n\n[Conservative Party (UK)] The Conservative Party, officially the Conservative and Unionist Party, is a centre-right political party in the United Kingdom. It is currently the governing party, having been so since the 2010 general election, where a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats was formed. In 2015, the Conservatives led by David Cameron won a surprise majority and formed the first Conservative majority government since 1992. However, the 2017 snap election on Thursday 8 June resulted in a hung parliament, and the Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority. They are reliant on the support of a Northern Irish political party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), in order to command a majority in the House of Commons through a confidence-and-supply deal. The party leader, Theresa May, has served as both Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister since 13 July 2016. It is the largest party in local government with 9,237 councillors. The Conservative Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United Kingdom, the other being its modern rival, the Labour Party. The Conservative Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defence, deregulation, and restrictions on trade unions.\n\n[Benjamin Disraeli] Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, (21 December 1804 – 19 April 1881) was a British statesman of the Conservative Party who twice served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, as well as a novelist. He played a central role in the creation of the modern Conservative Party, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the Liberal Party leader William Ewart Gladstone, and his one-nation conservatism or \"Tory democracy\". He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the British Empire. He is the only UK Prime Minister to have been of Jewish birth.\n\n[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1997] The 1997 Conservative Party leadership election was triggered in the British Conservative Party when John Major resigned on 2 May 1997, following his party's defeat at the 1997 general election, which ended 18 years of Conservative Government of the United Kingdom. Major had been Conservative leader and Prime Minister since November 1990.\n\n[Federation of Conservative Students] The Federation of Conservative Students (FCS) was the student organisation of the British Conservative Party from the late 1940s to 1986. It was created to act as a bridge between the student movement and the Conservative Party. In its final years it became known colloquially as \"Maggie's Militant Tendency\", in reference to then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and to Militant, an entryist group active in the Labour Party at the time. The FCS was then broken up by the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Norman Tebbit, after one of its members had accused previous former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan of war crimes in extraditing Cossacks to the Soviet Union. The FCS was replaced by the Conservative Collegiate Forum.\n\n[Christian Homann Schweigaard] Christian Homann Schweigaard (14 October 1838 – 24 March 1899 ) was a Norwegian Prime Minister.

Houston Independent School District] Wright v. Houston Independent School District was a 1972 American legal case brought by a parent of a student in the Houston Independent School District in Houston, Texas suing on behalf of her daughter and fellow students to prevent the district from teaching evolution as fact and without reference to alternative theories. The plaintiffs claimed evolutionary theory endorsed a secularist religious view, and argued the school's failure to incorporate the teaching of a particular religious alternative to evolutionary theory as derived from the Bible's creation account held that religious view up to ridicule and contempt. To allow evolution while avoiding creationism was unconstitutional, the suit claimed, because it advanced one particular sectarian view over another. The plaintiffs maintained that the school's evolutionary teaching constituted \"the establishment of a sectarian, atheistic religion\" and was an interference of their own rights to the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the Establishment clause in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure. Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's. Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed. Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion. Thus the birth of Modifications. It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance. FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence. Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal. Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash. Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them. Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s. During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions. The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices. During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization. Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow. The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'. that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow. Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead. This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder. The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally. The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally. Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions. Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason. Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification. Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds. While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008. The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate. It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders. Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned. Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public. Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.\n\n[First Church, Sandwich Massachusetts] First Church UCC (or “First Church,” or “First Church Sandwich,” or “First Church of Christ”) is a Congregational church in Sandwich Massachusetts founded in 1638 under Plymouth Colony Charter and the Mayflower Compact.

TPRS lessons use a mixture of reading and storytelling to help students learn a foreign language in a classroom setting. The method works in three steps: in step one the new vocabulary structures to be learned are taught using a combination of translation, gestures, and personalized questions; in step two those structures are used in a spoken class story; and finally, in step three, these same structures are used in a class reading. Throughout these three steps, the teacher will use a number of techniques to help make the target language comprehensible to the students, including careful limiting of vocabulary, constant asking of easy comprehension questions, frequent comprehension checks, and very short grammar explanations known as \"pop-up grammar\". Many teachers also assign additional reading activities such as free voluntary reading, and there have been several easy novels written by TPRS teachers for this purpose.\n\n[The Monkey Suit] \"The Monkey Suit\" is the twenty-first episode of the seventeenth season of the American animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\".

However, smoke from steam engines collected in the tunnels, leading to an uncomfortable passenger experience. Between 1863 and 1890, there were numerous proposals to build pneumatic or cable-hauled railways in London to overcome this problem, but none proved successful. Smoke was less of a problem in steam-hauled elevated railways, the first of which opened in New York City in 1870.\n\nQuestion: In which part of New York was the singer who released the song No Problem raised ?",

This insight gave impetus to the new fields of epidemiology and biomedicine, and most immediately allowed the resumption and completion of work on the Panama Canal (1904–1914) by the United States. Reed followed work started by Carlos Finlay and directed by George Miller Sternberg who has been called the \"first U.S. bacteriologist\".\n\n[Thomas Henry Thompson House] The Thomas Henry Thompson House is a historic house in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, United States, built in 1882. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was listed for its local significance in architecture and association with a significant individual. It is a locally notable example of Italianate architecture and was the home of business leader Thomas Henry Thompson, an Irish immigrant whose 1866 general store was the primary mercantile outfit in northwest Polk County.

He is known for Havelock's law (1907).\n\n[Moseley's law] Moseley's law is an empirical law concerning the characteristic x-rays that are emitted by atoms. The law was discovered and published by the English physicist Henry Moseley in 1913. It is historically important in quantitatively justifying the conception of the nuclear model of the atom, with all, or nearly all, positive charges of the atom located in the nucleus, and associated on an integer basis with atomic number. Until Moseley's work, \"atomic number\" was merely an element's place in the periodic table, and was not known to be associated with any measureable physical quantity. Moseley was able to show that the frequencies of certain characteristic X-rays emitted from chemical elements are proportional to the square of a number which was close to the element's atomic number; a finding which supported Van den Broek and Bohr's model of the atom in which the atomic number is the same as the number of positive charges in the nucleus of the atom. In brief, the law states that the square root of the frequency of the emitted x-ray is proportional to the atomic number.\n\n[X Club] The X Club was a dining club of nine men who supported the theories of natural selection and academic liberalism in late 19th-century England. Thomas Henry Huxley was the initiator: he called the first meeting for 3 November 1864. The club met in London once a month—except in July, August and September—from November 1864 until March 1893, and its members are believed to have wielded much influence over scientific thought. The members of the club were George Busk, Edward Frankland, Thomas Archer Hirst, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Thomas Henry Huxley, John Lubbock, Herbert Spencer, William Spottiswoode, and John Tyndall, united by a \"devotion to science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas.\"\n\n[Charles Drummond Ellis] Sir Charles Drummond Ellis FRS (b.Hampstead, 11 August 1895; died Cookham 10 January 1980) was an English physicist and scientific administrator.

He received a US patent 2,460,707 in February 1949, after a process of 17 years in discussions with the patent office. The main components of the patent were an LC circuit resonator and a set of vacuum power tubes of diode type using uranium and radium power sources and doped germanium semiconductors on the cathodes. It was an early example of doped semiconductors and a forerunner of radioactive power supplies using radioactive isotopes in space research. Moray's device followed other work on nuclear batteries first done in 1913 by Henry Moseley using a radium source.\n\n[Henry Moseley] Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley (23 November 1887 – 10 August 1915) was an English physicist, whose contribution to the science of physics was the justification from physical laws of the previous empirical and chemical concept of the atomic number. This stemmed from his development of Moseley's law in X-ray spectra. Moseley's Law justified many concepts in chemistry by sorting the chemical elements of the periodic table of the elements in a logical order based on their physics. He published first the Long Form periodic table or Modern periodic table which is used till date.\n\nQuestion: Thomas Henry Moray Followed work down on nuclear batteries in 1912 by this English physicist?",

Kosar resurfaced during the season with the Dallas Cowboys, when he was part of the eventual Super Bowl champions as a fill-in for injured quarterback Troy Aikman. The Browns get off to a 5-2 start despite the Quarterback Controversy. Prior to the start of the season the Browns signed Free Agent Quarterback Vinny Testaverde. Originally Testaverde was supposed to back-up his former University of Miami teammate Bernie Kosar. However, when Testaverde performed better when given the opportunity to play some felt there should be a change at the Quarterback position. However, the Browns went beyond that by unceremoniously releasing Kosar in the middle of the season.
